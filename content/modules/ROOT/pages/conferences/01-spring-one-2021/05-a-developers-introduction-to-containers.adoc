Container is a process or group of processes running in isolation; it is great for portability and security.
The way of achieving the process isolation is by leveraging several features of the Linux kernel:

== Namespaces
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces[Namespaces] wrap global system resources in an abstraction that makes it appear to the process within the namespace that they have their instance of the resource.

Process *one* and *zero* are typically reserved for what it takes to initialize our OS.
In a container, typically, the application is running an application with process id *one*.
That's a whole instance of the process id counter that's working inside the container that is different from what's happening outside, and that's achieved by having a separate namespace from within which to work.

== cgroups

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups[cgroups] are control groups allowing processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can be then limited and monitored.

Basically, it allows assigning a maximum number of resources each group can allocate to ensure your critical system processes always have the resources they need to run.
