Spring Data offers a common abstraction for various kinds of persistent stores.
The abstraction means that things look similar, and it's by no means that it's possible to just swap a one database out and another one in; otherwise, the common set of features would be limited, and the underlying technology features are not blocked.
Things look similar, so working with one gives an easy way in the other. Spring Data is famous for the ability to define repositories as interfaces conceptually from the domain-driven design.

Spring Data JPA is far more popular than Spring Data JDBC, but it brings a problem that is very complex, ex. it tries to map a graph of objects/classes to a graph of tables with no boundaries (lazy vs. eager), and it is needed to know what is behind saving and what is saving and what is controlled with cascade annotations.

Spring Data JDBC is yet another support for relational databases, such as Spring Data JPA but without JPA.
The key to its simplicity is strong aggregates.
Whatever is reachable from the root of the aggregates is part of that aggregates and gets persisted/loaded with that root, just as it is kind of prescribed by domain-driven design, the concept of aggregates comes from.

== User-defined IDs

If we call `CrudRepository#save` on the entity, it set its `@Id` to the particular value that is not present in the database, it fails since `UPDATE` is executed instead of `INSERT` (because `@Id` is filled) and results in 0 updated rows.

Solution is autowiring and calling `JdbcAggregateTepmlate#insert` that is used under the hood. Another solution is defining a bean `BeforeSaveCalback<Minion>` that generates for example `UUID` ID for the entity if it has not set ID yet.

== JSON / Custom conversion

We can persist an entity with an object property having further properties as JSON.

*To write:* Implement `Converter<MyEntityData, JdbcValue>`, annotate converter with `@WritingConverter`, and store as `JdbcValue.of(json, JDBCType.VARCHAR)`/
*To read:* Implement `Converter<JdbcValue, MyEntityData>`, annotate converter with `@ReadingConverter`, and read from JSON

It is needed to create a configuration class (annotated with `@Configuration`) extending from `AbstractJdbcConfiguration` overriding and registering a bean of `JdbcCustomConversions`.

== Bidirectional relationship

In the relationship 1:N `Minon` has `Set<Toy>`, the full-args constructor is annotated with `@PersistenceConstructor` to mark it for Spring Data and set a reference for each `Toy#setMinion` to `this`, and that reference in `Toy` must be `@Transient`.

Alternatively it is possible to use `AggregateReference<Minion, Long>` in `Toy` and use `@Query` in the `CrudRepository<Toy>` to get `Collection<Toy> by `Minion#getId()` from its `AggregateReference`.

== Caching

Just use Spring Data caching mechanism enabled by `@EnableCaching` and placed `@Cacheable` annotations.

== Eager loading references

To load data in a single statement it is possible to use a view such as `ToyView extends Toy` to simply include all `Toy` fields and embedded `Minion` field using `@Embedded(onEmpt = Embedded.OnEmpty.USE_EMPTY, prefix = "minion_")` annotation and fetch them in a repository using `@Query` with a `JOIN statement`.
