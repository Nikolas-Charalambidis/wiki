:pros: Impressive walkthrough of debugging truly complex issues around Tomcat, including network communication or Ubuntu, great explanation of the steps that proceeded
:cons: All issues were well-written, and an example of a poor one would be nice, the lip-smacking was very intensive and annoying with all due respect to the speaker

== Complex issues
Complex issues are subjective (everybody has a different understanding of this term), and three factors are not completely independent, but it tends one dominates more than the other.

* Issue that isn't 100% repeatable which typically means harder to debug, it drags the process out (get data, analyze, fix, repeat).
* Only occurs under load, which generates an awful load of application/debug logs, Wireshark, and network traces.
* Issues around concurrency tend to happen when multiple threads are interacting and a problem only occurs when a particular sequence of events happens between those threads.
* Methodology: Identify at a high level, record the state before/after and check the consistency of them with expectations, sometimes it is needed to record multiple points.
* To defy the statistical variation, it is needed more samples, load, and tests: at least 20 tests, at least 5 passes, and at least 5 failures, and keep adding tests and load until you meet all three.
* Beware and the issue can have multiple root causes.

== Use-case: link:https://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/texcre345tmyn337[Large and concurrent HTTP/2 responses]

This one is well-described, it took 1-2 days to fix.

Trouble with HTTP/2 (HTTP/2 connections are multiplexed: Multiple streams are trying to write and semaphore ensures only one writes at a time) during bulk data transfer (server -> client), multiple streams on same connection blocked indefinitely (configured an infinite timeout, so blocked until connection timeout).

> When a write operation is stuck servlet is not able to push any data to the client and the client is also stuck waiting for more data. There wasn't any error/exception at the client/server. `streamReadTimeout` and `streamWriteTimeout` are configured as `-1` so they are infinitely waiting for the write semaphore.

* Described details for a test case to be coded: writing large files (1GB - 5GB) on three or more concurrent streams.
* Described working HTTP/1.1 and non-working configurations (HTTP/2), reproducible both on blocking and non-blocking API

=== Root cause identification process

. Since fairly reproducible, it was possible to continually exclude functionality to narrow the focus: Disabling asyncIO proved it is where to start looking and provided a user a workaround (disable this functionality).
. It was possible to see threads waiting for semaphore (it should be released by Poller indicating ready to write), code review started (possible root cause was non-volatile `interestOps` flag) but volatile `interestOps` on a higher level of tests didn't show the issue was fixed as the test was failing - the importance of sufficient testing sample.
. Next step was to debug Socket/Poller interactions but added logging changed time timing and the issue became less repeatable so the logging strategy needed to be changed: copy relevant information to variables and log them after failure or event of interest that much less likely affects timing - but after a log of debugging Poller was working correctly.
. Poller was signaling write was possible but `OperationState` was `null` which was the potential root cause because the event couldn't be processed and semaphore was never released - although it was fixed, since reading and write operations are similar, the same error could exist elsewhere (read also affected but nobody hasn't stumbled across it yet).

== Use-case: link:https://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/bf6oz7ibxccvodd2[Connection drops before writing response]

Another well-written report but, the presenter had no access to the system where the issue could be created, 6 weeks to fix

Very occasionally Tomcat didn't send a response shown in the access log, with no exceptions and Wireshark shows the GET request was followed by a TCP FIN packet from Tomcat (clean TCP close).

=== Root cause identification process
. Asked various questions to try to eliminate features and/or possible failures:
  * Small response ~1kB (small enough to buffer entirely).
  * Typical response time 60ms (not timeout-related)
  * FIN sent 100Âµs after request received (no timeout-related).
  * The request was fully sent: no waiting for the rest of the request and not malformed)
  * User-agent -> Firewall -> Nginx -> Tomcat
  * HTTP/1.0 request (ruled out HTTP/2) indicator from network traces from Tomcat and Nginx.
  * Unique request IDS aided correlation across logs.
  * The issue started in the last month but no obvious changes released, systems were lightly loaded (20 requests/s).
. Configuration changes:
  * Switching from BIO to NIO didn't fix the issue (not in endpoint-specific code, less likely JVM issue)
  * Added `%b` configuration to access log to suggest JSP is generating response (it was)
  * No GZIP (no compression involved)
  * No obvious explanation.
. Custom debug code to provide detail on when things were happening (who is closing the socket) because it was closed long before Tomcat tried to write, but neither Tomcat nor the application was closing it - what the hell was it?
. After more logging, it showed the exception "Bad file descriptor" was swallowed, because it was assumed to be a dropped client connection (Tomcat changed to debug-log them), no indication file descriptors ran out, no other connections present between Nginx and Tomcat when the issue occurred and no indication of JRE mishandled file descriptors.
. `strace` time showed the socket close came from somewhere in the JRE and an attempt to correlate with thread dumps to identify where the close occurred showed a native library incorrectly managed the file descriptors associated with a fork and closed a file descriptor twice - in same cases the descriptor has already been re-used for the network connection which was hence closed.

=== Fix
Vendor accepted the native library (PDFTron) was at fault and provided instructions to disable the use, but Tomcat recommended switching to HTTP/1.1 for the Nginx/Tomcat connection to assure fewer and more persistent new connections do not constantly change the file descriptor so the native library was less likely is going to have the same one and then close it on you.

== Use-case: link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/2643[Response write does not compile]

Originates on the Spring Framework's issue tracker, well-written, but took 6 weeks to fix.

A small number of response writing fails to complete with WebFlux on Tomcat under load, low repeatability was the biggest issue as it was timing-sensitive.

Multiple issues identified:

* Spring handling of failed flushes.
* Incorrect Tomcat error handling:
** Attempted to flush the error page content after an I/O write error overwritten the original one.
** IO errors were not triggering to the error listener.
** Tomcat assumed `IOEception` would be seen by the container but WebFlux swallowed them.

=== Fix
After fixing the Spring issue, Tomcat now calls an error listener before internal error handling and it ended with JDK bug link:https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8263243[JDK-8263243] and Ubuntu bug link:https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1924298[1924298], because for once incoming connection there were two firings of the socket accept method and there should be a one-to-one mapping (so two threads were processing the same socket).

== Techniques
* Logging and Wireshark should use a 5-minute rolling window, don't be afraid to use `ERROR` logs.
* The network latency-related issues can be simulated in the supervisor.
* Choose the load generator carefully as they are not always completely space-compliant and might behave not the way you think (especially HTTP/2)
* It is often required to simulate lost connection at some point by literally two machines and "pulling out the cable".
* Test on multiple platforms since VM or bare metal seems to be less of an issue.
