:pros: Interesting overview of the extended testing pyramid.
:cons: Too much theoretical and abstract, missing real-life examples of what exactly is tested in each part.

Testing monolithic architecture heavily relies on End-To-End testing and prolongs testing cycle.

Testing microservice architecture involves testing a lot of small moving pieces, but system integration becomes more complex.

. Unit testing (isolation, mocking, and stubbing)
. Contract testing (contract creation and verification)
. System integration testing (system entry points)
. Backwards compatibility testing (two-step process)
. Performance testing (virtualize dependencies, short intervals, and quick feedback)
. Vulnerability testing
. Disruptive testing (dependency and API outage)
. E2E testing
. Browser compatibility testing (Selenium)
. Production Smoke testing (certificates, network connection).

For disruptive testing, it is possible to use link:https://github.com/codecentric/chaos-monkey-spring-boot[Spring Boot Chaos Monkey].
