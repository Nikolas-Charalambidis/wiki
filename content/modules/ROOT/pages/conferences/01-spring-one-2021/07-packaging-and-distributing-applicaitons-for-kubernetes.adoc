:pros: Well-structured presentation with a demo, they were able to find a workaround for an unexpected error they faced during the demo
:cons: Overly abstract terms (configuration, bundle, registers...) and commands in the demo were insufficiently described

Relocating K8S configurations and containers into the hands of their customers as a secure, consistent, and unified distribution within the framework of their existing ecosystem is clumsy.

Application lifecycle (packaging and deployment on K8S): Author Configuration -> Package and Distribution -> Customizing Configuration -> Deploy to Cluster.

Carvel is a composable Kubernetes tool suite, which provides a set of reliable, single-purpose, composable tools that aid in your application building, configuration, and deployment to Kubernetes.

Basic tools:

* `ytt`: Template and overlay K8S via YAML structures.
* `kbld`: Build or reference container images in K8S configuration in an immutable way.
* `kapp`: Install, upgrade, and delete multiple K8S resources as one application.
* `imgpkg`: Bundle and relocate application configuration (with images) via Docker registers.
