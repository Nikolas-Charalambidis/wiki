:pros: Very catchy speech, an excellent introduction to the environment properties management problem and comparison of approaches
:cons: The speaker has only one session

Spring applications environment configuration is based on Spring Environment Abstraction as of Spring 3.1 (`application.properties`, `application.yml`, command-args, JVM system properties...).

They can be in the filesystem and are very difficult to audit and manage across multiple applications and instances.

* Spring Environment Abstraction is extensible and has a solution for versioned (Git, Vault, DB, CredHub...), audited (git log) and centralized configuration - Spring Cloud Config Server.
* Such configuration must be read from the server and merged into Environment - Spring Cloud Config Server client library.
* Although Spring Config Server/Client can run on K8S, it must be merged into Resources, that are K8S native, like config-maps and secrets - Tanzu.

**Spring Cloud Config**: Central management of properties, can be versioned, can be audited, HTTP-based property consumption, probably should be secured, requires client-side library or code.

**K8S Config-maps and secrets**: Doesn't require special client code, K8S-native, not centrally managed, versioning/auditing is not built-in, can leverage K8S-native security.
