:rating: 5
:pros: Simple introduction to Spring security testing, TDD approach, OWASP mentioned
:cons: Session labeled as Intermediate/Advanced Spring track should include a sample of OAuth2 testing, and quite a short talk (22 mins of 30 mins available, other speakers use around 25-26 minutes)

Dependency `org.springframework.security:spring-security-test` brings helpers in `org.springframework.security.test.**` packages and more:

* `mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.webAppContextSetup(context).apply(springSecurity()).build();` using autowired `WebApplicationContext`
* `get("/greeting").with(user("Ria")).with(csrf()).andExpect(..)..`
* `String greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal(expression = "username") String username)` injects in the currently logged user's username and `String greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal CustomUser user)` to injects in a subtype of `UserDetails`.
