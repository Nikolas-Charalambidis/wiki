:pros: Theoretical aspects and importance of testing, best practices of unit testing.
:cons: Too short (not the speaker's fault), code examples weren't that impressive, no mention of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development[BDD] approach.

Automated tests should be human-readable and treated as same as the production code. They are repeatable and auditable.

**Dependency iceberg** says that our code is just a tip of all the code the application runs on.
The dependencies are below.

Most of the code are dependencies, feature and performance enhancements (Spring libraries, JSON/XML mappers, ORM implementation, servlets, etc.), and security patches.

We cannot rely 100% on it, especially if we use the last stable versions. On the other hand, old versions have security flaws (Struts).

How many automated tests should I write? Whatever gives me the confidence to deploy PROD without manual intervention (i.e. code coverage is just informative).

Manual testing is still needed, but it is exploratory testing.
