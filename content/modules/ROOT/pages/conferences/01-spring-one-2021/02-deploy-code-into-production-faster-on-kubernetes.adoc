:pros: Beginner-friendly introduction, on-spot developer concerns identification.
:cons: The structure doesn't match the agenda in the introduction and is a bit chaotic, rather Tanzu platform promotion, lacks expected pure K8S tips

Most of the Kubernetes offerings are delivered as a bag of parts:

* 63 % of organizations, that use K8S, use it as internal platforms or build internal platforms.
* 94 % of organizations, if use K8S, building internal platforms use more than one platform.
* 58 % of organizations agree that architectural decision-making has gotten harder.

Developer experience on DIY platforms is lacking.
Developers must still maintain containers, configure containers that run through multiple layers of YAML, and manage IT and security aspects.

Importance lies in tooling to help developers: leverage automatized DevOps practices, enforce organizational best practices, app-aware platform, and preconfigured templates by Ops.
