Taking an existing open-source Python project and then enhancing it and rapidly converting it into a production-grade application with the use of Spring:

* **Vaccine spotter** is an application that allows you to pick up a location by a ZIP code and shows all the appointments available at local retail pharmacies with external REST API.
* **Vaccine watch** is a Python bot application to query out to a specific region for un/available appointments and publishes those results out to social media networks like Twitter or Slack.

== JWatch application

=== Architecture

The whole application is divided into a *Consumer* and *Supplier* on top of the common Spring Boot Configuration.

* **Supplier** contains web clients to continuously call appointment APIs (Vaccine Spotter API and Proprietary Clinic API). The transformed business objects are handed up the stack o determine whether a particular appointment has already been published to our social media networks and then the state of that is stored inside Redis. A  RabbitMQ queue is fed by appointments.
* **Consumer** consumes RabbitMQ queue to push notifications to Twitter, Slack, and Email.
* **Spring Boot** configuration profiles and conditional beans are used to enable/disable functionality inside the application so we could deploy separate instances of the application.
* **RabbitMQ** is used, although it is a single application to break down the concern and make the application deployable.

=== Implementation

The main `JVWatchAppliatinon` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, `@EnableReactiveFeignClients`, `@EnableRedisRepositories`, and `@EnableConfigurationProperties`.

`RestTemplaete` class has effectively been deprecated in favor of configurable `WebClient` implementing reactive programming paradigm. Another way is using a reactive non-blocking Feign client through `@ReactiveFeignCient` annotation or Retrofit HTTP client as a part of the Spring Cloud Square project (incubator project as of the time of writing).

Feign client URL can be either hard coded, parameterized as a hardcoded URL, or a service name that interacts with some service discovery frameworks like Eureka.

Spring Cloud Streams framework can abstract us from knowing of implementation details of the underlying messaging system - the redesigned framework aligned with the Spring Cloud Functions framework which itself aligns with Java 8.

RabbitMQ (can be replaced with Kafka) is configured through `spring.cloud.stream.*` properties, `spring.cloud.stream.function`, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings`:

[,properties]
----
spring.cloud.stream.poller.fixed-delay=${jvwatch.checkTask.period}
spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=vaccineClinigDataSupplier;vaccineClinicDataSink
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSupplier-out-0.destinatnion=jvwatch-clinic-data
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.destinatnion=jvwatch-clinic-data
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.group=jvwatch-clinic-data-sink-group
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.concurrency=1
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.maxAttempts=4
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.backOffInitialInterval=15000
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.backOffMaxInterval=60000
----

There are defined beans `@PollableBean Supplier<Flux<ClinicData>> vaccineClinicDataSupplier()` and `@Bean Consumer<ClinicData> vaccineClinicDataSink()` where `@PollableBean` means that the supplier function gets executed on a configurable interval and its returned object then gets mapped into a messaging object that's bound to a destination like a topic ora queue in the underlying messaging system.

Spring Boot configuration allows configuration files with properties prefixes such as:

[,java]
----
@Configuration
@Configuration(prefix="jvwatch.notifications.twitter.oauth")
@Data
public class TwitterConfigProperties {

    // Code
}
