:pros: Entertaining folks, their speech appears like a natural dialogue.
:pros2: Huge code I can see well on a shaking mobile screen in a gym on a runner.
:pros3: Live demo with GraalVM, and native images explained with ease.
:cons: Garbage collector news and features between Java 9 and 11 deserve more space (for example modules, and `jshell` and `jpackage` commands).

== Java 11+ features

* **Records** are fancy immutable data structures with an auto-generated constructor and a form of getters accessing the data.
* Sadly it has no `copy` method in case we need to create the same record with just one changed property and another constructor is required.
* **Text blocks** enable working with built-in new lines.
* **Memory compaction through an array of records** as it represents just a bunch of data: `var points = new Point[] {point1, point2};`.
* **Enhanced null pointer exception** with a helpful message describing what exactly cannot be read and why (what is `null`).
* **Sealed classes** to allow the compiler to ask you if you have covered all the cases through `permits` in the `sealed` class. This feature interacts well with a `switch` statement as a defined set of permitted subclasses is final and known on compilation time - **Pattern matching** that is exhaustive. The implementations must be `final` or `sealed` to not break the definition hierarchy of sealed classes.
* **Smart casting** simplifies the `instanceof` syntax: `if (robot instanceof Vacuum v) { v.suck(); }`.

== Kotlin features

* Question mark operator (ex. `data class Bar(@Id val id: Long?, val name: String)`) says a field can be `null` and works as a sentinel or indicator on compile-time when we attempt to access a field from where is `null` allowed.
* Kotlin is null aware on compile-time, but in Java, it is handled in runtime.
* Kotlin introduces *co-routines* (`kotlinx.coroutines.*` package) for reactive programming through ad-hoc polymorphism - it works as a suspendable function that can release the control to a scheduler that finds another co-routine ready to run in a lightweight manner allowing millions of them.
* `suspend` keyword to a function allows a function to be paused and resumed at a later time.

== Test containers

**Test Containers** help to alleviate as much variability between local development, integration or CI tests, and production.

== GraalVM

* Spring Boot has a built-in ability to turn a source code into a container with all needed to run the application using `bootBuildImage` in Maven/Gradle (`./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=kotlin-bars`.
* GraalVM and Spring Native can create a very optimized version of the application, containers are about 40 MB large only.
* An alternative to writing Dockerfiles that are hard to maintain and write is using build packs - the Cloud Native Computing Foundation created the standard called *Build Packs* that takes any source code and turns it into a Docker container - *Paketo*.
* A file `build.gradle.kts` configures the `bootBuildImage` task: Setting `"BP_NATIVE_IMAGE" to "1"` in `environment` turns on Spring Native and GraalVM enabling to create a native image where GraalVM is doing ahead-of-time compilation to compact it down.
* Reflection is heavily used by Spring and it is something that cannot be done ahead of time, so Spring introduced reflection points hooks to fit well with GraalVM.
