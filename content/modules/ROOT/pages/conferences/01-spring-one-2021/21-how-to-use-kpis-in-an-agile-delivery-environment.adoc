Measuring in an Agile environment is problematic as businesses have been curious to measure a few specific elements: *scope* delivered on *time*, on *spec*, and on *budget* without compromising quality -> golden triangle.

Time has changed but basic needs remain valid, we have to improve and change in perspective: *what* should be measured, *how* to be measured, and more importantly *why*?

== What
Identify that helps to deliver on time, remove waste, improve quality, reduce cycle line, increase customer satisfaction, stay ahead of the competition and most importantly make/save more money.

Goodhart's Law applies:

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"

Cobra effect is related: it is that a well-intentioned measure can often backfire and have the opposite effect to intended as happened in India - Intention: Reduce cobra population -> Action: A bounty for dead cobras -> Effect: People start cobra farming (increased population).

Once What is identified, derive **How** having a *Goal* -> *How* do we achieve it -> *How* do we measure it

=== Example: We want to deliver on time

* ⛔ Work extra hours -> Log hours/swipes
* ⚠️ Drive 'good estimation' -> Track committed vs. delivered user stories
* ⛔ Add more people/teams -> Scaling numbers of teams/members, how quickly they get in track
* ⚠️ Introduce test automation -> Automation coverage
* ✅ Reduce 'cycle time' -> Control charts
* ⛔ Identify 'defects' early -> Defect count in development environment
* ✅ Identify dependencies early -> Backlog scoring

== Why
Why do we measure what we measure?
We want to avoid knowing too late, or too little (to solve the root of the problem rather than symptomatically), and we want to know the right things and most importantly, we want *to do something about it*.

== Measurement

Measurement should be done with specific views:

* **Productivity:** Are we improving our ability to *deliver* products over time? -> Change in amount of working product delivered per Sprint.
* **Value delivery:** Are we *prioritizing* the right features to deliver first? -> Business value per unit of a team effort.
* **Quality:** Are we meeting our *quality* standards? -> Defect rate or service downtime.
* **Sustainability:** Are we working in a way we can continue *for the long* run? -> Mental well-being and technical debt.

If we look at measures using **Correct perspective** (the customer/consumer perspective), we can replace KPI with **CPI** (Customer Performance Indicator), i.e. how the customer would benefit:

* Productivity -> **Reduced Costs**
* Value delivery -> **Optimal Features**
* Quality -> **Better Product**
* Sustainability -> **Continuity**

== Executive dashboard

Example:

* **Wrong:** Story completion itself doesn't make sense as 3 teams are covered delivering in 4 different sprints, two chats are portraying the same information (defect patterns and cumulative story points vs. defects), pie charts with colors misinterpret the meaning
* **Correct:** Velocity delta (velocity as points against sprints), revenue delta (revenue per story point against time) happiness delta (subjective happiness against time).

To use KPIs correctly, identify project/program objectives and goals, set few but "well-thought-out" measures (not becoming targets) and make them transparent, and review them periodically (do they allow us to drive corrections/improvements) and rinse & repeat.
