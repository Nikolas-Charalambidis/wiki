:pros: Broad overview of microservice architecture facilities and difficulties
:cons: Missing introduction into cloud-native concepts since this is marked as beginner-friendly, too many buzzwords, .NET examples

**Pros**: Microservice architecture provides easy-to-maintain, test, and deploy services, teams can be scaled, polyglot-friendly.

**Cons**: Distributed systems are rather complex, and interaction is difficult to test, memory consumption and overhead.

== Cloud-native patterns
* Consistent management
* Run everywhere
* Secure
* Seamlessly adopt new environments
* Distributed systems patterns and abstractions.

Steeltoe Project introduction on top of the .NET foundation enables building production-grade and cloud-native microsystems in a simplified way quickly to stand up.

* Scalability (service discovery, configuration providers)
* Resilience (circuit breaker, bulkhead, client-side load balancing)
* Ease of Use (initializer, autoconfiguration, platform providers, and connectors such as DB, MQ, OAuth)
* Observability (management endpoints, dynamic logging, distributed tracing, metrics)
* Security (SSO, JWT auth, certificates)
* Messaging (stream processing)
