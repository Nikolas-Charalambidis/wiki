:pros: Great session about how Spring Cloud Gateway becomes handy for application modernization as a simple solution able to fulfill a lot of solution requirements. Interesting architecture lesson.
:cons: Fewer abbreviations (who knows SCG stands for Spring Cloud Gateway).
:cons2: Confusing speakers switching.
:cons3: The cons of Spring Cloud Gateway were not mentioned.

== Legacy application
The decade-old application about to be modernized:

* AARP is a nonprofit organization empowering people to *choose how they live*, advocating healthcare, social security, and health insurance, and serves more than 40 million members today.
* DSM manages the Digital and Membership strategies for AARP including the technology and production of content on [aarp.org](aarp.org) and the AARP Now application, and strategies that help them to *acquire*, *maintain* and *bring value to members*.

=== Legacy setup
The legacy application consists of over 30 applications and monoliths:

* No meaningful auto-scaling (it was based on CPU/Memory but not actual incoming traffic).
* No gateway.
* No throttling.
* No rule-based routing.

=== Needed solution
Migrate to modernized application *gradually without impacting* the functionality, and application metrics and with a *quick rollback strategy* to the original state, *Throttle the traffic* into the new applications incrementally and route traffic to legacy and new service *at the same time*.

== Modernization strategy
Break down monolithic apps (key piece), gradually peel off one service at a time, and route traffic to legacy and new services, SCG was the solution for routing, A/B testing, traffic splitting, ruling by header values.

=== Blue-Green deployment
* Outlined requirement as part of application modernization: Spring Cloud Gateway became the fundamental enabler to achieve it using header values.
* Spring Cloud Gateway enabled quick switching and roll-back between a new service and legacy solution (50:50) for A/B testing and load measurements of the infrastructure.

=== Pros of Spring Cloud Gateway
* Developer-friendly works seamlessly with the platform.
* Keeps things simple
* Easy integration.
* Comprehensive configuration list.
* Avoids the need for other expensive products.
