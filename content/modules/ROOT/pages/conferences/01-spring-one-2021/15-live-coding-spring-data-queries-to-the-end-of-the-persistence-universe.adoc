:pros: Auditing introduction, very beginner-friendly
:cons: Since beginner-friendly, the database structure could be introduced (especially how auditing stores additional data)

Spring Data JPA has a pre-baked `JpaRepository` that extends `PagingAndSortingRepository` from Spring Data.

For debugging, enable `spring.jpa.show-sql=true` and `logging.level.org.springframework.data=TRACE`.

Having a 1:N relationship between Manager and Employee entities using Spring Data JPA:

* `List<Employee> findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String partialName)` for full-text search.
* `List<Employee> findByManagerName(String managerName)` query navigates across relationships.

Use `@EnableJpaAuditing` and register `@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)` on the Employee object to enable auditing through `@CreatedDate` and `@LastModifiedDate`.
