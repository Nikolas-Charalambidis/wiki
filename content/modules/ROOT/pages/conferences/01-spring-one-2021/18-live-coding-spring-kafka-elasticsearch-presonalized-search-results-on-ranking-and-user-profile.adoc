:pros: Informative overview of what Elasticsearch is capable of, although the live demo is impossible to follow but still impressive
:cons: The way result popularity in real-time was updated from Kafka was not clearly explained.
:cons2: It's not clear why Kafka figures in the demo if an easier approach could be used
:cons3: Data structure should be shown as not everybody has experience with Elasticsearch (all because I guess mostly caused by lack of time)

== ElasticSearch Analyzers
By default, ElasticSearch finds by an exact match, to enable easy search using a single letter ignoring accented characters (`Ã©`, `Ã­`, etc...) it is needed to use ElasticSearch Analyzers utilizing `POST _analyze` with `"tokenizer": "standard"` and `"char_filter"` with `pattern_replace` "type` to replace anything that is not an alphanumeric character.

To get rid of capital letters and non-ASCII characters, it is needed to add token:
[,json]
----
"filter" : ["asciifolding", "lowercase"]
----
...and a specific `edge-ngram` among them.

It is needed to delete the former index and recreate the index.

Each `hit` has a `_score` that sets the element order in the returned structure.

For search by fields, it is possible to add *boosting*, ex. boost the search of artist name `artist_name` by a factor of 5 (exact match should have a bigger score) as `artist_name^5` or `artist_name.prefix^1` where are the generated tokens stored.

`"fuzziness" : 1` enables to match other elements (ex. `"query": "sezan"` would match `Selena Gomez` with a low `_score` since there is a partial match in individual letters from search (basically allows typos).

== Boosting results by popularity
If the search is based on a single letter (`s`), `Shakira` might be placed below `Selena GomÃ©z` although the popularity says otherwise (I like Shakira more, though). It is needed to enable scoring on a search through `POST /content/_search` and provide `"script_score"` in `"functions"` in `"function_score"` in `"query"`: `
[,json]
----
"script" : {
    "source" : "Math.max(((!doc['ranking'].empty )
        ? Math.log10(doc.['ranking'].value)
        : 1), 1)",
    "lang" : "painless"
}`
----

Assuming the popularity is updated programmatically (200 asynchronous hits by Kafka) it is needed to process the listen-event messages and place them in listen-event indices using: `POST /listen-event-*/_search/`. User profiles are also getting generated (`POST /user-profile/_search`).

== Boosting by user behavior
If a particular user searches for a certain element, that element should be boosted in the search for that particular user only. Another function must be taken into account similarly as previous boosting:
[,json]
----
"script" : {
    "source" : "params.boosts.get(doc[params.artistIdFieldName].value)",
    "lang" : "painless",
    "params" : { ..
    }
}
----
