:quote: Anyone can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand - Martin Fowler
:quote2: It is not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time... Leave the campground cleaner than you found it - Boy Scout Rule, Robert C. Martin

:pros: Very beginner-friendly and two fair quotes, though famous clichÃ©s.
:cons: Extremely short talk although the topic itself is rich in ideas.  Nothing new compared to already well-known and widely presented blog posts.
:cons2: What is the real meaning behind the "one reason to change" clichÃ©?
:cons3: Introducing `includeSetupAndTeardownPages` way is not a good idea as we might finally end up with `includeSetupAndRegisterAndLoginAndTeardownPagesUnformattedUTF8Encoded` etc.

Clean code is *simple*, *understandable* and *maintainable* to care about *teamwork*, *reusability* and *growth*, is easy to read, focused, tested, and SOLID.

* **Naming**: Use descriptive, clear, and searchable names that can be pronounced well and according to context ~ classes, functions, variables, everything.
* **Functions**: They should be small, do one thing with as least as arguments possible, have one reason to change, and follow the single responsibility principle.
* **Comments**: Avoid commenting out code chunks and use them only as a clarification of code as code is the best documentation itself.
* **Classes**: Class name must be short, show its responsibility, and have only one responsibility and only one reason to change.
* **Tests** Should be independent of each other, fast, executed in a short time, and have one assert per test.
