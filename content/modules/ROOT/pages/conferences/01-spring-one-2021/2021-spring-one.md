## [Live Coding Spring, Kafka, & Elasticsearch: Personalized Search Results on Ranking and User Profile](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/spring-kafka-elasticsearch)
- Length 26:42, watched on 2021-09-13, **#spring #elasticsearch**
- Erdem Günay as CTO, Layermark
- Track: Architecture
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- ElasticSearch-based indexed search using analyzers and filters with a boost by popularity and by user behavior.
- `GET /_cat/indices` returns all the indices
- `POST /content/_search` queries the `content` index but an exception is thrown if the index is not found (`PUT /content`/`POST /content/_bulk`).
- **ElasticSearch Analyzers**
  - By default, ElasticSearch finds by an exact match, to enable easy search using a single letter ignoring accented characters (`é`, `í`, etc...) it is needed to use ElasticSearch Analyzers utilizing `POST _analyze` with `"tokenizer": "standard"` and `"char_filter"` with `pattern_replace` "type` to replace anything that is not an alphanumeric character.
  - To get rid of capital letters and non-ASCII characters, it is needed to add token `"filter" : ["asciifolding", "lowercase"]` and a specific `edge-ngram` among them.
  - It is needed to delete the former index and recreate the index.
  - Each `hit` has a `_score` that sets the element order in the returned structure.
  - For search by fields, it is possible to add *boosting*, ex. boost the search of artist name `artist_name` by a factor of 5 (exact match should have a bigger score) as `artist_name^5` or `artist_name.prefix^1` where are the generated tokens stored. 
  - `"fuzziness" : 1` enables to match other elements (ex. `"query": "sezan"` would match `Selena Gomez` with a low `_score` since there is a partial match in individual letters from search (basically allows typos).
- **Boosting results by popularity**
  - If the search is based on a single letter (`s`), `Shakira` might be placed below `Selena Goméz` although the popularity says otherwise (I like Shakira more, though). It is needed to enable scoring on a search through `POST /content/_search` and provide `"script_score"` in `"functions"` in `"function_score"` in `"query"`: `"script" { "source" : "Math.max(((!doc['ranking'].empty ) ? Math.log10(doc.['ranking'].value) : 1), 1)", "lang" : "painless" }`.
  - Assuming the popularity is updated programmatically (200 asynchronous hits by Kafka) it is needed to process the listen-event messages and place them in listen-event indices using `POST /listen-event-*/_search/`. User profiles are also getting generated (`POST /user-profile/_search`).
 - **Boosting by user behavior**
   - If a particular user searches for a certain element, that element should be bosted in the search for that particular user only. 
   - Another function must be taken into account similarly as previous boosting: `"script" : { "source" : "params.boosts.get(doc[params.artistIdFieldName].value)", "lang" : "painless", "params" : { .. } }`.

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Informative overview of what is ElasticSearch capable of, although, the live demo is impossible to follow but still impressive
- ⛔ The way result popularity in real-time was updated from Kafka was not clearly explained, it's not clear why Kafka figures in the demo if an easier approach could be used and the title is misleading then, data structure could be shown as not everybody has experience with ElasticSearch (all because I guess mostly caused by of lack of time)

## [Debugging Complex Issues in Web Applications](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/debugging-complex-issues-in-web-applications)
> "It is often required to simulate lost connection at some point by literally two machines and "pulling out the cable."
- Length 51:15, watched on 2021-09-14, **#spring #tomcat**
- Mark Thomas as Staff Engineer, VMware
- Track: Intermediate/Advanced Spring
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- **Complex issues** are subjective (everybody has a different understanding o this term), and three factors are not completely independent but it tends one dominates more than the other.
  - Issue that isn't 100% repeatable which typically means harder to debug, it drags the process out (get data, analyze, fix, repeat).
  - Only occurs under load, which generates an awful load of application/debug logs, Wireshark, and network traces.
  - Issues around concurrency tend to happen when multiple threads are interacting and a problem only occurs when a particular sequence of events happens between those threads.
  - Methodology: Identify at a high level, record the state before/after and check the consistency of them with expectations, sometimes it is needed to record multiple points.
    - To defy the statistical variation, it is needed more samples, load, and tests: at least 20 tests, at least 5 passes, and at least 5 failures, and keep adding tests and load until you meet all three.
    - Beware and the issue can have multiple root causes.
- **Use-case: [Large and concurrent HTTP/2 responses](https://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/texcre345tmyn337)** - well-described, 1-2 days to fix
  - Trouble with HTTP/2 (HTTP/2 connections are multiplexed: Multiple streams are trying to write and semaphore ensures only one writes at a time) during bulk data transfer (server -> client), multiple streams on same connection blocked indefinitely (configured an infinite timeout, so blocked until connection timeout).
    - > When a write operation is stuck servlet is not able to push any data to the client and the client is also stuck waiting for more data. There wasn't any error/exception at the client/server. `streamReadTimeout` and `streamWriteTimeout` are configured as `-1` so they are infinitely waiting for the write semaphore.
    - Described details for a test case to be coded: writing large files (1GB - 5GB) on three or more concurrent streams.
    - Described working HTTP/1.1 and non-working configurations (HTTP/2), reproducible both on blocking and non-blocking API
  - Identify root cause process:
    1. Since fairly reproducible, it was possible to continually exclude functionality to narrow the focus: Disabling asyncIO proved it is where to start looking and provided a user a workaround (disable this functionality).
    2. It was possible to see threads waiting for semaphore (it should be released by Poller indicating ready to write), code review started (possible root cause was non-volatile `interestOps` flag) but volatile `interestOps` on a higher level of tests didn't show the issue was fixed as the test was failing - the importance of sufficient testing sample.
    3. Next step was to debug Socket/Poller interactions but added logging changed time timing and the issue became less repeatable so the logging strategy needed to be changed: copy relevant information to variables and log them after failure or event of interest that much less likely affects timing - but after a log of debugging Poller was working correctly.
    4. Poller was signaling write was possible but `OperationState` was `null` which was the potential root cause because the event couldn't be processed and semaphore was never released - although it was fixed, since reading and write operations are similar, the same error could exist elsewhere (read also affected but nobody hasn't stumbled across it yet).
    5. Fix: https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/92b91857
- **Use-case: [Connection drops before writing response](https://tomcat.markmail.org/thread/bf6oz7ibxccvodd2)** ~ well-written report but, the presenter had no access to the system where the issue could be created, 6 weeks to fix
  - Very occasionally Tomcat didn't send a response shown in the access log, with no exceptions and Wireshark shows the GET request was followed by a TCP FIN packet from Tomcat (clean TCP close).
  - Identify root cause process:
    1. Asked various questions to try to eliminate features and/or possible failures: small response ~1kB (small enough to buffer entirely), typical response time 60m (not timeout-related), FIN sent 100µs after request received (no timeout-related), the request was fully sent (no waiting for the rest of the request and not malformed), User-agent -> Firewall -> Nginx -> Tomcat, HTTP/1.0 request (ruled out HTTP/2), no indicator from network traces from Tomcat and Nginx, unique request IDS aided correlation across logs, issue started in the last month but no obvious changes released, systems were lightly loaded (20 requests/s).
    2. Configuration changes: Switching from BIO to NIO didn't fix the issue (not in endpoint-specific code, less likely JVM issue),  added `%b` configuration to access log to suggest JSP is generating response (it was), no GZIP (no compression involved), no obvious explanation.
    3. Custom debug code to provide detail on when things were happening (who is closing the socket) because it was closed long before Tomcat tried to write, but neither Tomcat nor the application was closing it - what the hell was it?
    4. After more logging, it showed the exception "Bad file descriptor" was swallowed, because it was assumed to be a dropped client connection (Tomcat changed to debug-log them), no indication file descriptors ran out, no other connections present between Nginx and Tomcat when the issue occurred and no indication of JRE mishandled file descriptors.
    5. `strace` time showed the socket close came from somewhere in the JRE and an attempt to correlate with thread dumps to identify where the close occurred showed a native library incorrectly managed the file descriptors associated with a fork and closed a file descriptor twice - in same cases the descriptor has already been re-used for the network connection which was hence closed.
    6. Vendor accepted the native library (PDFTron) was at fault and provided instructions to disable the use, but Tomcat recommended switching to HTTP/1.1 for the Nginx/Tomcat connection to assure fewer and more persistent new connections do not constantly change the file descriptor so the native library was less likely is going to have the same one and then close it on you.
- **Use-case: [Response write does not compile](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/26434)** ~ originate on Spring Framework's issue tracker, well-written, 6 weeks to fix
  - A small number of response writing fails to complete with WebFlux on Tomcat under load, low repeatability was the biggest issue as it was timing-sensitive.
  - Multiple issues identified: Spring handling of failed flushes, incorrect Tomcat error handling (attempted to flush the error page content after an I/O write error overwritten the original one, IO errs were not triggering to the error listener, Tomcat assumed `IOEception` would be seen by the container but WebFlux swallowed them).
  - After fixing the Spring issue, Tomcat now calls an error listener before internal error handling and it ended with [JDK bug](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8263243) and [Ubuntu bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1924298) because for once incoming connection there were two firings of the socket accept method and there should be a one-to-one mapping (so two threads were processing the same socket).
- **Techniques**
  - Logging and Wireshark should use a 5-minute rolling window, don't be afraid to use `ERROR` logs, the network latency-related issues can be simulated in the supervisor, choose the load generator carefully as they are not always completely spec-compliant and might behave not the way you think (especially HTTP/2), it is often required to simulate lost connection at some point by literally two machines and "pulling out the cable", test on multiple platforms since VM or bare metal seems to be less of an issue.

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Impressive walkthrough of debugging truly complex issues around Tomcat including network communication or Ubuntu, and great explanation of the steps that proceeded.
- ⛔ All issues were well-written and an example of a poor one would be nice, the lip-smacking was very intensive and annoying with all due respect to the speaker.

## [Spring Boot—Production Boost](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/spring-boot-production-boost)
- Length 26:09, watched on 2021-09-14, **#spring #kubernetes**
- Thomas Vitale as Senior Software Engineer, Systematic
- Track: Beginner-Friendly Spring
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- If Flyway should be used with a Reactive application, it is needed to provide a JDBC connection to Flyway as it doesn't support R2DBC drivers.
- **Spring Actuator**
  - `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*` exposes all endpoints, although it is better to make a selection
  - `GET /actuator/health` is a base health endpoint including components (Database), liveness, and readiness needed especially for Kubernetes.
    - Liveness if `DOWN`, Kubernetes restarts the container because it means it entered into a faulty state
    - Readiness if `DOWN` means that the application cannot handle more requests so Kubernetes stops sending traffic to that specific instance
  - `GET /actuator/flyway` returns all the information regarding the migrations, stored in database relation `flyway_schema_history` with all the migration statuses that have been run.
  - `GET /actuator/prometheus` returns useful metrics about the application easy to scrap from the Prometheus server and show them in dashboards such as Grafana.
  - `GET /actuator/heapdump` creates a snapshot of heap memory to investigate ex. memory leaks and fix memory issues.
- **Packaging** (Gradle is in examples but for Maven it works the same) 
  - `./gradlew bootJar` packs the application as a fat jar, a standalone jar with all the dependencies needed by the application to run correctly with no external dependency except the JVM, which is easily deployable to cloud platforms like Heroku or Azure.
  - To make the application even more portable and deployable on a platform like Kubernetes, it is possible to package the application as a container image using `./gradle bootBuildImage`.
  - Spring Boot Plugin uses under-the-hood cloud-native build backs which is a specification to convert application source into container images without a need to provide a Dockerfile (Spring uses `packeto-buildbacks` implementation to produce production-ready images good for security and optimized for both building and running).
  - *Java Memory Calculator* is included in the final image and configures heap and non-heap memory of the JVM running in the container at start-up.
 - **Properties configuration**
   - Property files for a local development environment but Spring Ecosystem provide also has different strategies
   - A good strategy is that property files define the default value used in the deployment environment (URL to the local DB), for all properties not related to the infrastructure used Configuration Services like Spring Cloud Config (connection pools, timeouts, and retries, feature flags, external services with URLs, usernames and passwords, or PAAS specific properties), and Kubernetes specific properties with Spring Active Profiles and internal services (URLs, usernames, and passwords) use K8S Config Maps and Secrets. 
   - **Configuring Resources for JVM containers**
     - CPU: Is a compressible resource and throttles when its limit is hit - application still runs.
     - Memory: It is not a compressible resource and is OOMKilled when its limit is killed - application crashes
     - It is recommended to set in `containers` K8S YAML configuration `resources.requests.memory` and `resources.requests.cpu` and `resources.limits.memory` to assign minimum values to the container - it is also a good practice to set `requests` and `limits` values equal to guarantee the best performance.
     - To get some start-up boost it is possible to omit the CPU limit as long as we know it is a compressible resource.
   - Remember to set liveness and readiness probes in K8S YAML configuration `containers.livenessProbe` and `conainers.readinessProbe` - especially `httpGet.path`, `httpGet.port`, `initialDelaySeconds` and `periodSeconds`.
  
### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Handful overview of Spring Kubernetes and production friendly features that Spring Boot Actuator provides out-of-box.  
- ⛔ The application could be ready to save some time (although the gist of the talk is to highlight quick rollout to production).

## [How to Use KPIs in an Agile Delivery Environment](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/how-to-use-kpis-in-an-agile-delivery-environment)

- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- Measuring in an Agile environment is problematic as businesses have been curious to measure a few specific elements: *scope* delivered on *time*, on *spec*, and on *budget* without compromising quality -> golden triangle.
- Time has changed but basic needs remain valid, we have to improve and change in perspective: *what* should be measured, *how* to be measured, and more importantly *why*?
  - **What:** Identify that helps to deliver on time, remove waste, improve quality, reduce cycle line, increase customer satisfaction, stay ahead of the competition and most importantly make/save more money.
    - Goodhart's Law applies: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" - Cobra effect is related.
    - Cobra effect is that a well-intentioned measure can often backfire and have the opposite effect to intended as happened in India - Intention: Reduce cobra population -> Action: A bounty for dead cobras -> Effect: People start cobra farming (increased population).
  - Once What is identified, derive **How** having a *Goal* -> *How* do we achieve it -> *How* do we measure it - Example: We want to deliver on time:
    - ⛔Work extra hours -> Log hours/swipes
    - ⚠️ Drive 'good estimation' -> Track committed vs. delivered user stories
    - ⛔Add more people/teams -> Scaling numbers (of teams/members), how quickly they get in track
    - ⚠️ Introduce test automation -> Automation coverage
    - ✅ Reduce 'cycle time' -> Control charts
    - ⛔ Identify 'defects' early -> Defect count in development environment 
    - ✅ Identify dependencies early -> Backlog scoring
  - **Why** do we measure what we measure?
    - We want to avoid knowing too late, or too little (to solve the root of the problem rather than symptomatically) and we want to know the right things and most importantly, we want *to do something about it*.
- Measurement should be done with specific views:
  - **Productivity:** Are we improving our ability to *deliver* products over time? - Change in amount of working product delivered per Sprint.
  - **Value delivery:** Are we *prioritizing* the right features to deliver first? - Business value per unit of a team effort.
  - **Quality:** Are we meeting our *quality* standards? - Defect rate or service downtime.
  - **Sustainability:** Are we working in a way we can continue *for the long* run? - Mental well-being and technical debt.
- If we look at measures using **Correct perspective** (the customer/consumer perspective), we can replace KPI with **CPI** (Customer Performance Indicator), i.e. how the customer would benefit:
  - Productivity -> **Reduced Costs**
  - Value delivery -> **Optimal Features**
  - Quality -> **Better Product**
  - Sustainability -> **Continuity**
- Executive Dashboard example:
  - **Wrong**: Story completion itself doesn't make sense as 3 teams are covered delivering in 4 different sprints, two chats are portraying the same information (defect patterns and cumulative story points vs. defects), pie charts with colors misinterpret the meaning
  - **Correct**: Velocity delta (velocity as points against sprints), revenue delta (revenue per story point against time) happiness delta (subjective happiness against time).
- To use KPIs correctly, identify project/program objectives and goals, set few but "well thought out" measures (not becoming targets) and make them transparent, and review them periodically (do they allow us to drive corrections/improvements) and rinse & repeat.
  
### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Highly educative and well-presented approach to the KPI/CPI with examples. Two on-spot quotes.

- Antonia Horvath as Delivery Lead & Design Manager, VMware Tanzu Labs
- Track: Agile Leadership
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- Design altitude were design delivers value: **Surface** (look), **Structure**, **Strategy**, **Big picture**
  - Visual design (Surface + small part of Structure), User Experience (Surface + Structure), Product Design (Surface + Structure + Strategy), Strategy Design (Structure + Strategy + Big Picture).
- **Balanced Teams**: From day one of when a product is kicked off, designers, product managers, and software engineers work hand in hand, so they share accountability for the overall outcome, not only their discipline - each one is a core partner in the overall success from the day zero.
- 7 things that will change for the better when we have a designer on our team:
  - They can teach us to *listen* with humble curiosity, and with the genuine intention to *change our minds* based on what is said.
    - They can help us prevent building stuff that no one will use through *lab engagements* to run user research every one or two weeks including every single member of the team - listening users get to learn how to ask open-closed questions and interact with users.
    - Listening to users makes one so humble and makes one see how often the assumptions about this idea thought to be true aren't true at all.
  - They can bring *meaning* to our work by helping us * empathize* with the people we serve.
    - User research participants can make the whole team realize the product they are building can spark the kind of like behavior change in people which is incredibly powerful.
    - Bringing meaning into the center of our team by empathizing with the users.
   - They take chaos* and bring *order* to it as they are trained to turn uncertainty and complexity into human solutions.
     - Every product starts with such uncertainty and chaos.
     - For example, Covid-19 tracking application: Designers collaborate with the engineers, architects, and scientists to come up with the kind of like messaging logic of who and when would be pinged under extreme circumstances, i.e. so many edge cases, dependencies, and daily changing official guidelines - the result is an application so easy to use for users.
   - They are great at recognizing *when change is needed* and can optimize a team's processes and ways of working.
     - It is not only about the use of interfaces but also internal team and organization processes and seeing what can be changed for the better.
  - They are *great facilitators* as they can enable a large group of people to do their best thinking, and synthesize those perspectives into actionable insights.
  - They can help us change the world as their designs can spark impactful * behavior changes* in people.
    - For example, one wants to visualize data but the people that we need to input the data aren't the people that benefit from it, such as *timesheets* - behavior change and making sure people that people stick with it is a part of the product and that's when a designer can make a huge impact. 
  - They can help us tell stories & communicate in a way that *inspires* our audience.
    - They are great writers and UX copywriting is a whole discipline in itself so the way that the text in an application is written matters so much but it's not only text but also telling stories through images - a team would never be short appealing mockups.
- How to bring *designer* closer to the team? Rather than just go off and hire a designer follow a couple of concrete steps beginning with making engineers friends with a designer expand the cycle because people who we surround at work matter.
  1. Make our team's assumptions explicit about the software about to be written
  2. Learn about, and introduce user research in our team as it is very simple
  3. Run a design studio (at least a scathing session) for the next product challenge or new feature kick-off

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ A mind-opening presentation about how a designer can be helpful with a team and organization.
- ⛔ Works with false assumptions and premises that all software engineers are extroverts and love spending time daily in the office, the talk could be more remote-friendly due to the Covid-19 situation (and international remote workers).

- Steve Hawkins as Sr. Manager Converged Infrastructure, BT
- Track: Agile Leadership
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- **BT's (company name) transformation** to remain relevant and competitive is modernizing the organization and architecture.
  - Accelerate transition and adoption of modern methods to become more responsive to customer needs as well as remove complexity and legacy to reduce time to market.
  - The organization is changing to a flatter, more accountable structure and is pivoting to tribes/squad structures to enhance decision powers.
  - Drive towards major Public Cloud adoption (SaaS), however, there was a bit of hesitancy and uncertainty from a security perspective. 
  - In practical terms: Simplify the architecture (customer journies, system interactions), modernize the application estate, establish a new operating model, introduce agile working practices and remove legacy.
- **Problem statement**: Months of analysis to clearly understand the impacts on the IT estate, ability to realize cost savings for well-defined and realizable plans, and modernization needed traction.
- **Tribe overview**: Opportunities (establish management), Cost and Plans (overall plans, decommissioning, timing), Knowledge Repository (aggregate application knowledge, automation for data sources, reporting), Refactoring Outcomes (disaggregation to microservices, decommissioning outcomes, single prioritized backlog, community) and Decommissioning Outcomes (delivery of outcomes, KPI with a single backlog).
- **Flow of the work**: Taking application in the Opportunities squad, looking at it from the EA roadmaps for categorization trying to analyze the estate to establish the right group of applications, and gradually filtering it out so at the end of the pipeline we end up with a refactoring candidate or potentially decommissioning candidate.
  - Decision trees and multiple views of a point such as costs or people effort associated with these applications, time to refactor, complexity, value delivered, and to deliver.
  - Refactoring technology approach takes a functionally discrete slice (from a set of functionalities so it can be easily refactored) and rebuilds as a microservice delivering a decoupled and resilient service. 
- **Scaling the work**: Establish multiple squads on a per application bases and leverage best practices, patterns, and methods.

### Impression ⭐⭐☆☆☆
- ✅ A complex session covering the code part of modernizing and also the people, processes, and kind of more a holistic approach, the speaker is a true professional in what he does, watching for the second time makes everything more sense, extracted two on-spot quotes defining this talk
- ⛔ Overly academical resulting in a hard focus, no definition of modernization, extremely abstract terms (examples needed), unfriendly slideshow throwing tons of small text with each slide, vague shortcuts (EA, BAU, CoE, SA)

- Trisha Gee as Lead Java Advocate, JetBrains
- Track: Beginner-Friendly Spring
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- Developers like to update to the latest and greatest technologies because it's fun to do, and it's hard to be immune to this disease, For example, applying a new technology results in the application would look like before but hopefully it might have slightly better performance, however:
  - We can't measure performance until it's implemented.
  - New technologies have limited documentation.
  - I wanted to use a niche implementation... if I succeed, I'd be *the expert*.
- **Why** - *"Fear of missing out"* leads us, so we should forget all of that, release the fear, and think of the real reasons:
  - **For the business**
    - Some technologies gain popularity and some eventually die off, which is good news as we don't need to learn all technologies to make a decision on which ones to use going forward. 
    - Invest time in two or three technologies to see how they work and observe which stick around for a longer time, so pick up them in a new project as they become more relevant.
    - For example, a data set is irregular and a relational database is not suitable to represent these data drives a need to learn a document database technology like MongoDB or a graph database like Neo4j where relationships are more important than the data itself.
    - *Approach*: Build spikes/prototypes and start using non-production code first (build, deploy, CI/CD, test) such as internal tools or a new project/service, and it's important to share the knowledge and possibly get the experts if needed.
  - **For the team**
    - Usually, releases are painful and lengthy, and introducing the correct tools and processes reduces the time and manual work, development costs, and team frustration - it is also about mindset.
    - Testing is hard and inconsistent, introducing a correct tool can help to produce more readable, expressive, effective, and well-documented tests.
    - *Approach*: Build spikes/prototypes and start using non-production code first (build, deploy, CI/CD, test) such as internal tools or skunkwork projects (hack days) that might or might not prove valuable in time (developer plugins, new products...).
  - **For you**
    - *Reasons*: I want to have fun, I want to be a technology guru in my job, I want a new job, I don't want to be left behind...
    - It is important to focus on technologies that are more important to us than we need them, we don't have to learn everything right now just in case we need it.
    - *Approaches*: Blogs, tutorials & videos, online events & streams, user groups, online courses, books, pet projects, join an open-source project, find a project at work or get a new job.
- **Developers and business needs don't match**, the approaches for the business and the team overlap themselves but not for ourselves, because we want to learn a new technology personally and not build a new production service, so how do bridge the gap?
  - *"Create a culture of continuous learning in our environment"* to bridge the gap between the developers and the business needs.
  - Protected time for learning, brown bags/lunch & learn / book clubs, user groups, hack days, skunkworks, **20% time**, conferences.
  - The bottleneck is not what we type but learning, it is discovery, and figuring out what is going on, so it is needed to learn outside the scope of our particular codebase.
- **Rule 20% of time** says we should have dedicated 20% of our working time to self-education where developers don't do what business wants them to do, but there is a lot of value to it because developers will be doing something that might have value to the business later or might have a value to the team because we can work on things like continuous delivery or deployment pipeline.
  - **Risks**: Some organizations are not necessarily sold on investing this sort of time in these activities.
    - If they upskill the developers, the upskilled developers will up and leave.
    - A higher risk is not giving them training and space to grow and learn, they will leave anyway.
  - **Benefits**:
    - Doing these activities would more likely retain developers and the organization will have highly skilled ready to adopt the right tool at the right time.
    - Happy developers will more likely stay in the organization and contribute as fully as they can.
- As a developer, don't panic, although coming to the conference might be overwhelming, try to write down the stuff that is interesting to us.
 
### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ An helpful presentation providing reasons and approaches to why, where, and how should we learn new technologies to not panic. 
- ⛔ I still panic.

- Bruce Eckel as President, Mindview LLC
- James Ward as Developer Relations Engineer, Google Cloud
- Track: Architecture
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- **Java 11+ features**:
  - **Records** are fancy immutable data structures with an auto-generated constructor and a form of getters accessing the data. 
    - Sadly it has no `copy` method in case we need to create the same record with just one changed property and another constructor is required.
  - **Text blocks** enable working with built-in new lines.
  - **Memory compaction through an array of records** as it represents just a bunch of data: `var points = new Point[] {point1, point2};`.
  - **Enhanced null pointer exception** with a helpful message describing what exactly cannot be read and why (what is `null`).
  - **Sealed classes** to allow the compiler to ask you if you have covered all the cases through `permits` in the `sealed` class.
    - This feature interacts well with a `switch` statement as a defined set of permitted subclasses is final and known on compilation time - **Pattern matching** that is exhaustive.
    - The implementations must be `final` or `sealed` to not break the definition hierarchy of sealed classes.
  - **Smart casting** simplifies the `instanceof` syntax: `if (robot instanceof Vacuum v) { v.suck(); }`.
- **Kotlin:**
  - Question mark operator (ex. `data class Bar(@Id val id: Long?, val name: String)`) says a field can be `null` and works as a sentinel or indicator on compile-time when we attempt to access a field from where is `null` allowed. 
  - Kotlin is null aware on compile-time, but in Java, it is handled in runtime.
  - Kotlin introduces *co-routines* (`kotlinx.coroutines.*` package) for reactive programming through ad-hoc polymorphism - it works as a suspendable function that can release the control to a scheduler that finds another co-routine ready to run in a lightweight manner allowing millions of them. 
  - `suspend` keyword to a function allows a function to be paused and resumed at a later time. 
- **Test Containers** help to alleviate as much variability between local development, integration or CI tests, and production.
- **GraalVM:**
  - Spring Boot has a built-in ability to turn a source code into a container with all needed to run the application using `bootBuildImage` in Maven/Gradle (`./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=kotlin-bars`.
  - GraalVM and Spring Native can create a very optimized version of the application, containers are about 40 MB large only.
  - An alternative to writing Dockerfiles that are hard to maintain and write is using build packs - the Cloud Native Computing Foundation created the standard called *Build Packs* that takes any source code and turns it into a Docker container - **Paketo**.
  - A file `build.gradle.kts` configures the `bootBuildImage` task: Setting `"BP_NATIVE_IMAGE" to "1"` in `environment` turns on Spring Native and GraalVM enabling to create a native image where GraalVM is doing ahead-of-time compilation to compact it down. 
  - Reflection is heavily used by Spring and it is something that cannot be done ahead of time, so Spring introduced reflection points hooks to fit well with GraalVM.

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ Entertaining folks, their speech appears like a natural dialogue, huge code I can see well on a shaking mobile screen in a gym on a runner, live demo with GraalVM, and native images explained with ease.
- ⛔ Garbage collector news and features between Java 9 and 11 deserve more space (for example modules, and `jshell` and `jpackage` commands).

- Track: Architecture
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes
- Clean code is *simple*, *understandable* and *maintainable* to care about *teamwork*, *reusability* and *growth*.
- Clean code is easy to read, focused, tested, and SOLID.
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, clear, and searchable names that can be pronounced well and according to context ~ classes, functions, variables, everything.
- **Functions**: They should be small, do one thing with as least as arguments possible, have one reason to change, and follow the single responsibility principle.
- **Comments**: Avoid commenting out code chunks and use them only as a clarification of code as code is the best documentation itself.
- **Classes**: Class name must be short, show its responsibility, and have only one responsibility and only one reason to change.
- **Tests** Should be independent of each other, fast, executed in a short time, and have one assert per test.

### Impression ⭐☆☆☆☆
- ✅ Very beginner-friendly. Two on-spot quotes.
- ⛔ Extremely short talk although the topic itself is rich in ideas. Nothing new compared to already well-known and widely presented blog posts. What is the real meaning behind the "one reason to change" cliché? Introducing `includeSetupAndTeardownPages` way is not a good idea as we might finally end up with `includeSetupAndRegisterAndLoginAndTeardownPagesUnformattedUTF8Encoded` etc.

- Greg Meyer as Director, Distinguished Engineer, Cerner Corp.
- Track: Beginner-Friendly Spring
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes:
- Taking an existing open-source Python project and then enhancing it and rapidly converting it into a production-grade application with the use of Spring:
  - **Vaccine spotter** is an application that allows you to pick up a location by a ZIP code and shows all the appointments available at local retail pharmacies with external REST API.
  - **Vaccine watch** is a Python bot application to query out to a specific region for un/available appointments and publishes those results out to social media networks like Twitter or Slack.
- **JVWatch** application:
  - **Architecture**: The whole application is divided into a *Consumer* and *Supplier* on top of the common Spring Boot Configuration.
    - **Supplier** contains web clients to continuously call appointment APIs (Vaccine Spotter API and Proprietary Clinic API). The transformed business objects are handed up the stack o determine whether or not a particular appointment has already been published to our social media networks and then the state of that is stored inside Redis. A  RabbitMQ queue is fed by appointments.
    - **Consumer** consumes RabbitMQ queue to push notifications to Twitter, Slack, and Email.
    - **Spring Boot* configuration profiles and conditional beans are used to enable/disable functionality inside the application so we could deploy separate instances of the application.
    - **RabbitMQ** is used although it is a single application to break down the concern and make the application deployable.
  - **Implementation**
    - The main `JVWatchAppliatinon` class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`, `@EnableReactiveFeignClients`, `@EnableRedisRepositories`, and `@EnableConfigurationProperties`.
    - `RestTemplaete` class has effectively been deprecated in favor of configurable `WebClient` implementing reactive programming paradigm. Another way is using a reactive non-blocking Feign client through `@ReactiveFeignCient` annotation or Retrofit HTTP client as a part of the Spring Cloud Square project (incubator project as of the time of writing).
    - Feign client URL can be either hard coded, parameterized as a hardcoded URL, or a service name that interacts with some service discovery frameworks like Eureka.
    - Spring Cloud Streams framework can abstract us from knowing of implementation details of the underlying messaging system - the redesigned framework aligned with the Spring Cloud Functions framework which itself aligns with Java 8.
    - RabbitMQ (can be replaced with Kafka) is configured through `spring.cloud.stream.*` properties, `spring.cloud.stream.function`, `spring.cloud.stream.bindings`:
    - ```
      spring.cloud.stream.poller.fixed-delay=${jvwatch.checkTask.period}
      spring.cloud.stream.function.definition=vaccineClinigDataSupplier;vaccineClinicDataSink
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSupplier-out-0.destinatnion=jvwatch-clinic-data
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.destinatnion=jvwatch-clinic-data
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.group=jvwatch-clinic-data-sink-group
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.concurrency=1
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.maxAttempts=4
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.backOffInitialInterval=15000
      spring.cloud.stream.bindings.vaccineClinicDataSink-in-0.consumer.backOffMaxInterval=60000
      ```
    - There are defined beans `@PollableBean Supplier<Flux<ClinicData>> vaccineClinicDataSupplier()` and `@Bean Consumer<ClinicData> vaccineClinicDataSink()` where `@PollableBean` means that the supplier function gets executed on a configurable interval and its returned object then gets mapped into a messaging object that's bound to a destination like a topic ora queue in the underlying messaging system.
    - Spring Boot configuration allows configuration files with properties prefixes such as: 
    - ```
      @Configuration @Configuration(prefix="jvwatch.notifications.twitter.oauth")` @Data
      public class TwitterConfigProperties {... }
      ```

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- ✅ A very impressive tale o a real application built on top of well-suited technologies able to ship into production quickly. Introduction of Spring Cloud projects and alternatives.  
- ⛔ Incorrect usage of Stream API with a side-effect. Lack of time for deployment.

### Keynotes:
- The decade-old application about to be modernized:
  - AARP is a nonprofit organization empowering people to *choose how they live*, advocating healthcare, social security, and health insurance, and serves more than 40 million members today.
  - DSM manages the Digital and Membership strategies for AARP including the technology and production of content on [aarp.org](aarp.org) and the AARP Now application, and strategies that help them to *acquire*, *maintain* and *bring value to members*.
- **Legacy setup** consisting of over 30 applications and monoliths:
  - *Web server* -> multiple *ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)* -> 1:1 *EC2* Tomcat Application (multiple instances).
  - No meaningful auto-scaling (it was based on CPU/Memory but not actual incoming traffic), no gateway, no throttling, and no rule-based routing...
- **Needed solution**: Migrate to modernized application *gradually without impacting* the functionality, and application metrics and with a *quick rollback strategy* to the original state, *Throttle the traffic* into the new applications incrementally and route traffic to legacy and new service *at the same time*.
- **Modernization strategy**: Break down monolithic apps (key piece), gradually peel off one service at a time, and route traffic to legacy and new services, SCG was the solution for routing, A/B testing, traffic splitting, ruling by header values.
  - **Blue-Green deployment**:
    - Outlined requirement as part of application modernization - Spring Cloud Gateway became the fundamental enabler to achieve it using header values.
    - Spring Cloud Gateway enabled quick switching and roll-back between a new service and legacy solution (50:50) for A/B testing and load measurements of the infrastructure
- **The setup**:
  - *Webproxy* -> *SCG* -> routing to *Tanzu Platform* and *Legacy platform* (through *Webserver*).
- **Pros of Spring Cloud Gateway**:
  - Developer-friendly works seamlessly with the platform, keeps things simple, easy integration, comprehensive configuration list, and avoids the need for other expensive products.
 
### Impression ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
- ✅ Great session about how Spring Cloud Gateway becomes handy for application modernization as a simple solution able to fulfill a lot of solution requirements. Interesting architecture lesson.
- ⛔ Fewer abbreviations (who knows SCG stands for Spring Cloud Gateway). Confusing speakers switching. The cons of Spring Cloud Gateway were not mentioned.

- Jakub Pilimon as Software Engineer, VMware
- Track: Architecture
- Language: English 🇺🇸

### Keynotes:
- Things used to be simple, i.e. having few monoliths. Nowadays we have dozens, hundreds of services dropping daily new versions and a scattered team around the globe. Architects cannot and don't want to be involved in every single decision that teams have to make. 
  - They have to **empower** our teams to make good decisions and embrace the notion of **distributed decision-making**.
  - They have to step in and **establish principles** to put on guardrails and guideposts to help teams make good decisions. A way to go is to **leverage the power of defaults**.
- From observations, distributed systems have similar needs and a lot of things come up over and over: Monitoring, circuit breakers, consumer-driven contracts, gateways, streams, externalized configuration, functions, service discovery, load balancing, documentation -> we cannot reinvent the wheel on every single project and the focus should be led on critical design decisions while empowering teams to solve critical business problems.
- **Twelve-factor app**
  - They are characteristics shared by successful apps (by Heroku).
    1. One codebase in version control, multiple deploys
    1. Explicitly defined dependencies
    1. Configuration separated from the code
    1. Backing services are just attached resources (trivial swap out, loose coupling) 
    1. Build, release and run lifecycle
    1. Stateless (durable, not in memory)
    1. Export services via port binding
    1. Scale via process (to scale horizontally)
    1. Start up fast and shut down gracefully (all in seconds, apps need to be disposable)
    1. Dev/Prod parity (from commit to production)
    1. Treat logs as event streams (no file system)
    1. Admin tasks run as one-off processes (database migrations etc.)
  - Does an application have to be fully 12-factor compliant? Nope, but should be a goal but be also ruthlessly pragmatic. **Think of it as a continuum.** Applications need to be designed properly to take the advantage of that.
  - For greenfield applications, go cloud native and don't build a legacy.
- **Monitoring** is vital to a thriving distributed architecture to know what is going on. Four primary components: 
  - Logging in to know what happened. 
  - Tracing (correlation) -> Spring Cloud Sleuth. It covers spans, sampling, and key:value pairs, it adds trace and span IDs, and stock ingress and egress points instrumented and generated Zipkin compatible traces if desired.
  - Dashboards to view the health of service and monitor key metrics involving usually infrastructure (CPU, RAM, threads, DB connections, availability, latency, response time, etc. identified earlier as part of the SLO (service level objectives)). Also the traffic level and error-failed requests etc.
  - Alerts to alert then something goes wonky and fix it ideally before the customers even notice. It means pager duty for what there has to be clear and concise on-call duty documentation. Alerts should be urgent, actionable, and require human intervention.
    > "'We don't rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training' - Archilochus"
  - Number of tools from Wavefront to Dynatrace to New Relic -> Spring Boot Actuator.
  - **Spring Boot Actuator**
    - It is needed to use Spring Web dependencies from Initializr to enable the HTTP communication (JMX is yet another option).
    - `/actuator/beans`: The information about beans including their scope and type provided by the application
    - `/actuator/env`: The classpath, Java vendor, timezone, OS, etc.
    - `/actuator/caches/:` The caches
    - `/actuator/mappings` The HTTP mappings
    - `/actuator/scheduledtasks`: The scheduled tasks
    - `/actuator/shutdown`: To shutdown the application gracefully
    - It is possible to include Spring Security to secure the endpoints
    - It is possible to configure the custom actuator endpoints using the annotations: `@Endpoint`, `@JmxEndpoint`, `@WebEndpoint`, `@ReadOperation`, `@WriteOperation`, etc.
    - **All endpoints are enabled but not exposed by default**, which means they are by default included by the actuator.
       ```
       management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true
       management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
       ```
- **Fault tolerance**
  - We cannot prevent failure, but we can be prepared for it.
  - How to react? Error message? Backup service? Rely on cached data? Return default answer? ... *it depends*.
  - A circuit breaker is a good way to go as it watches the calls and makes sure that something that is broken doesn't get continually called.
  - Once the failure threshold is exceeded, the circuit is open and you can't complete the circuit anymore and it redirects to a fallback mechanism. Every so often it pokes the original service if it is healthy yet, so let's back to normal and close the circuit.
  - Circuit breakers are vital for healthy microservices, easy to add and customers would thank you or they don't notice at all.
  - It is better to display the user a manual error quickly than let them wait for a long time to fail and very rarely succeed.
  - **Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker** has a consistent API and allows developers to pick the implementation: Netflix Hystrix, Resilience4j, Sentinel, Spring Retry (`org.springframework.cloud`:`spring-cloud-starter-circuitbreaker-resilience4j`).
    - All can be configured as necessary and all provide a basic default configuration.
    - Free to change value thresholds, slow call thresholds, and sliding window size.
    - [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/programs/ab.html) is a simple command line tool for benchmarks.
    - ```
      ab -n 100 http:localhost:8080/evaluate
      ```
    - Configuring a circuit breaker is done through `CircuitBreakerConfig` with either a default configuration `ofDefaults()` or a custom one (`custom()`).
    - ```
      CircuitBreakerConfig.custom()
          .failureRateThreshold(5)                          //several consecutive failing values require to open the circuit
          .waitDurationInOpenState(Duration.ofMillis(1000)) // duration in the open state
          .slidingWindowSize(2)                             // used to record the outcome of calls when the circuit breaker is closed
          .build()
      ```
- **Event-driven architecture** has multiple event patterns. Which to choose? ... *it depends*, it's all about trade-offs.
  - Event notification (for example a new client registration):
    - Something happens and the system shouts into the void (like banging a cowbell), and the emitter usually doesn't care what happens the next. 
    - This is great for being highly asynchronous and compliant with the 0th law of computer science: High cohesion and low coupling. 
    - The downside is that it is difficult to debug, to reason about the system, and easy to lose sight of the flow - that's why monitoring is crucial.
  - Event-carried state transfer (for example a client changed his address): 
    - The event carries the detail so the event subscribers don't need to ask for the details and it is an example of "tell, not ask". 
    - It reduces latency and lowers the overhead to the source systems (it doesn't mean the data get tossed around), and receivers need to handle the state.
  - Event sourcing: 
    - We record every single state change, so it turns out that the event store is the record of truth and not the database.
    - Kafka is a friend for this as it serves as a strong audit log, allows to recreate history, and makes it easy to run hypotheticals, although evolving schemas can be painful. It is challenging to replay when we interact with outside systems.
  - CQRS as Command Query Responsibility Segregation:
    - It splits the data structure into one that reads and the one that writes, which is not necessarily event-driven per se but you sort of see it combined with these approaches.
  - **How to do distributed transactions in the cloud? They don't**.
    - A real-world example: You buy a t-shirt in a shop with a return policy. The shop doesn't keep the transaction open until the return period expires. The sale is committed, if you return a t-shirt, there is a series of compensating transactions (put the t-shirt into inventory, issue you a credit, etc.).
  - **Spring Cloud Stream** for architects that want flexibility because the architecture is often defined as the decisions that are hard to change.
    - Spring Cloud Stream allows swapping brokers and using what's right for the team, so is middleware neutral.
    - It supports as expected: Kafka, RabbitMQ (`org.springframework.cloud`:`spring-cloud-starter-stream-rabbit`), Kinesis plus various partner-maintained bits.
    - It provides a binder to the external brokers that serve as a bridge between the application and the broker.
    - It allows us to implement our binder and integration-test them.
    - Destination binder connects to your messaging system, and handles the boilerplate configuration bits, so one can focus only on the business problem.

### Impression ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆
- ✅ Great and informative content on implementing architectural patterns with Spring Boot, nice explanation of an event-driven architecture, brilliant quotes, and nice-to-listen presentation style
- ⛔ They were cut off and such a situation should have been handled better (both organizers and presenters).
