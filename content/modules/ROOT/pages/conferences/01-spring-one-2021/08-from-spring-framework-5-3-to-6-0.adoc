== Spring Framework 5.3.x

* Java 17 support against a Java 8 baseline, support in Spring Boot 2.6 as of November 2021.
* Java EE 8 focus against a Java EE 7 baseline.

== Spring Framework 6.0
* Development branch (main) will be established in mid of September, the milestone phase at the end of 2021 (`6.0.M1` version), release candidate phase in mid-2022 (`6.0.RC1`). and `6.0` GA in October 2022.
* Release cadence is yet undecided, might follow Boot's half-year rhythm.
* Spring Native initiative moves into Spring proper, AOT processed metadata for regular JVM deployment as well.
* Introduces core abstractions

== Spring Boot 3.0
* Spring Boot 3.0 introduces a starter for native applications, build plugins and support for specific GraalVM versions, and auto-configuring the observability backend.
* Java 17 enforces illegal access rules, and no general escape hatch anymore.
