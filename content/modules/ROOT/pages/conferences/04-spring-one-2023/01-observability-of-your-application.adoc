* Spring Boot Actuator
* Prometheus server to collect the metrics.
* Micrometer for metrics and distributed tracing support.
* Zipkin reporter to assure applications send SpanID in the Zipkin format.

== Grafana dashboard

The dashboard confirms that it is not just a one-off error, and we can see that it is happening to multiple users.

=== Tracing

We can drill down and look at the traces to look at a specific request and see what error is happening:

* Explore -> "Search" query type -> Tags: `error=true` -> Select Trace ID.

It is possible to switch between viewing tracing and monitoring data.

=== Metrics

We can monitor the CPU and heap.

If one of the services cause latency spikes, so we can find out the service responsible for slowing down the system or whether the real cause is HTTP or database.

We can see a trace *before* and *after* the latency spike if we attach metadata to the metrics, i.e. attaching Trace ID and Span ID to the metrics.

=== Summary

* Correlated metadata
** Logs to Traces (and vice versa)
** Traces to Metrics (via common tags)
** Metrics to Traces (via exemplars) to Logs
* The Spring portfolio is instrumented: WebMVB, WebFlux, etc. instrumentation
* Third-party libraries are also instrumented: `jdbc-observations`, OpenFeign, etc.

== Micrometer

=== Micrometer 1.9 (May 2022)

* OLTP Registry (OpenTelemetry line protocol).
** Just put the OLTP registry onto the classpath.
* `HighCardinalityTagsDetector`.
* Exemplars (Prometheus).
** Metadata attached to the metrics (sampling the metadata, attaching Trace ID and Span ID into the time series).

=== Micrometer 1.10 (November 2022)

Mostly restructuring and renaming packages incorporating distributed tracing into Micrometer by default.

* Micrometer Tracing (Sleuth without Spring dependencies).
** Distributed tracing support.
* Micrometer Docs generator.
** Instrumentation documentation generation, list of tags, etc.
* Micrometer Context Propagation.
* Observation AP(`micrometer-core`).
** New set of API.

==== Observation API

Each observation must have a name and to be passed into the observation registry.

Configuring the observation and instrumenting some business logic example (all the handlers registered will be called):

[,java]
----
ObservationRegistry registry = ObservationRegistry.create();

registry.observationConfig()
    .observationHandler(new MeterHandler(...))
    .observationHandler(new TracingHandler(...))
    .observationHandler(new LoggingHandler(...))
    .observationHandler(new AuditEventHandler(...));
----

[,java]
----
Observation observation = Observation.start("s1", registry);
try (Observation.Scope scope = observation.openScope()) {
    Thread.sleep(1000); // Business logic
} catch (Exception exception)
    observation.error(exception);
} finally {
    // TODO: attach tags (key-value)
    observation.stop();
}
----

The observation can be created but not started.

[,java]
----
Observation.createNotStarted("talk", registry)
    .lowCardinalityKeyValue("conference", "S1")
    .highCardinalityKeyValue("speakerId", speakerId)
    .observe(this::talk);
----

We don't need to be that verbose:
[,java]
----
@Observed
public void talk() {
    // Business logic
}
----
