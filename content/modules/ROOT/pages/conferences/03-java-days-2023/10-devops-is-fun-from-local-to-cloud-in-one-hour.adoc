:pros: Practical session mentioning Jib, Kubernetes, Terraform and Pulmi as there are not too many such sessions.
:pros2: Meme guy.
:cons: While Pulmi seems to solve out a lot of problems, the presented TypeScript in the Java talk was a faux pas as the most known language among the attendees (Java) should be used as the demonstrative one.
:cons2: Pulmi rather scared me due to non-intuitivity of the code, or the explanation was not clear.

== DevOps

Traditional view:

* Devs are responsible for developing new features.
* Ops making apps fast and reliable.

Common problems:

* Ops don't understand the app (how could they?).
* Devs don't have necessary tools to troubleshoot apps.
* Inefficient and uncooperative communication (the issue is ping-ponged back and forth).

Why do we (Devs&Ops) develop apps?

* To support business -> business wants changes -> changes make apps unstable -> solution? *Tools* and *culture* to support the common goal.

DevOps:

* Faster development lifecycle and troubleshooting and more engaged teams: Not just coding Java classes but making them configurable as he will configure it, prepare it for future
* More table apps
* Higher level of automation

== DevOps in practice

Spring has a CLI to generate a project from the Spring Initializr into the IDE: `spring init -l kotlin -d web -x`

The build has to be standardized as our local environment has different environment variables and settings affecting the build and runtime.

== CI

Define a pipeline that builds the application in a Docker image:
.`.gitlab-ci.yml`
[,yml]
----
stages:
  - build
build:
  image: amazoncorretto:20-alpine
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - chmod +x ./gradlew
  script:
    - ./gradle build --no-daemon
----

Best practices:
- Gradle: cache `.gradle`
- Kotlin: use `detekt` for static analysis and `klint` for linting:
[,kt]
----
plugins {
    id("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt") version "1.21.0"
}

dependencies {
    detectPlugins("io.gitlab.arturbosch.detekt:detekt-formatter")
}
----

== Docker

.`Dockerfile`
[,bash]
----
FROM amazoncorretto:20-alpine
COPY build/libs/*.jar app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
----

and add the Docker image build to the build pipeline:

.`.gitlab-ci.yml`
[,yml]
----
stages:
  ...
build:
  ...
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/libs/*.jar
build-docker-image:
  image: docker:cli
  needs:
    - job: build
  stage: build
  services:
    - docker:dind
  variables:
    DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2376
    DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2
    DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: /certs
    DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY: 1
    DOCKER_CERT_PATH: $DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR/client
  before_script:
    - mkdir -p #HOME/.docker/
    - echo "$DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG" > $HOME/.docker/config.json
  script:
    - docker build -t demo:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
    - docker push demo:${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
----
Jobs are isolated so `build` and `build-docker-iamge` don't share the artifacts together by default, so `artifacts` and `needs` is used.

Best practices:

* Use Jib for daemonless and fast builds that uses layers efficiently
* Don't use `root` user
* Scan for vulnerabilities

== Cloud infrastructure

Cloud is not needed or suitable for every application, though is quick to enroll.

What we want:

* My colleague needs to enroll a new environment as I did before, so we need a mechanism to record changes
* The loud set-up and infrastructure needs to be versioned.
* We want to share the configuration and discuss over it on pull requests
* So we want IAAS (infrastructure as a code), for example Terraform or Pulumi

=== Pulumi

The infrastructure can be in the same repository, let's say `infrastructure` directory.

Initialization:

* `pulumi new typescript` (the language of configuration)
* It generates `Pulumi.yaml` and typescript boilerplate such as `index.ts`, `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

.`package.json`
[,json]
----
    ...
    "dependencies": {
        "@pulumi/pulumi": "^3.0.0",
        "@pulumi/gcp": "^6.66.0"
    }
----

.`index.ts`
[,ts]
----
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi"
import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp"

// Project definition
const myProject = new gcp.organizations.Project("myProject", {
    orgId: "12345678901",
    projectId: "java-days-2023",
    billingAccoung: "ABC12-DEF34-GHI56"
});

// Activate the cloud service
const cloudRunService = new gcp.projects.Service("cloud-run", {
    project: myProject.projectId,
    service "run.googleapis.com"
});

// Use the service
const service = new gcp.cloudrunv2.Service("backend", {
    project: myProject.projectId,
    location: "europe-west3",
    template: {
        containers: [
            {
                image: pulumi.interpolate`demo:${new pulumi.Config().require("version)}
            }
        ]
    }
}, { dependsOn: cloudRunService }); // pulumi by default initializes by parallel (sometimes guesses), so it is needed to define dependencies

// Make the application available through authorization
new gcp.cloudrun.IamBinding("my-iam-binding", {
    project: myProject.projectId,
    location: "europe-west3",
    service: service.name,
    role: "roles/run.invoker",
    members: ["allUsers"] // allows all users to access the service
});

export const backendUrl = service.uri;
----

Resources (ex. database in cloud) are distributed by providers (AWS solution, Docker).


Apply `pulumi up` or `pulumi up -c version=19cb95fa` for a build of a certain version to be used by the script (`${new pulumi.Config().require("version)}`).

Check the output with `pulumi stack output`.

Terraform vs. Pulumi:

* HCL vs TypeScript, Go, .NET, Python, Java (one can use the language which is comfortable with, it also enables ID support, ESLint, Prettier, etc.)
* Declarative vs Imperative: Terraform struggles to define a resource conditionally as there is no simple way to declare `if`, so hacks with count and non/empty arrays are needed:
.`index.ts`
[,tf]
----
resource "azuread_group" "default" {
  count = var.setup_group == true ? 1 : 0
  dynamic "owners" {
    for_each = var.setup_owners ? [1] : [0]
    content {
      concat(var.terraform_users, [azuread_service_principal.default[0].id])
    }
  }
}

output "ad_group_id" {
  value = join("", azuread_group.default.*.object_id)
}
----

== CD

We need a service account so GitLab can deploy to cloud.

Introduce the CI/CD environment variables in GitHub: `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG`, `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` and `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
Extend the GitLab pipeline and infrastructure:

.`.gitlab-ci.yml`
[,yml]
----
stages:
  - build
  - deploy
build:
  ...
build-docker-image:
  ...
deploy
  stage: deploy
  image: pulumi/pulumi-nodejs:3.8.0
  needs:
    - job: builder-docker-image
  before_script:
    - cd infrastructure
    - npm i
  script:
    - pulumi up -s dev -y --skip-preview --config version=${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}
----

.`index.ts`
[,ts]
----
const sa = new gcp.serviceaccount.Account("gitlab", {
    project: myProject.projectId,
    accountId: "gitlab"
});

new gcp.projects.IAMBinding("gitlab", {
    project: myProject.projectId,
    role: "roles/owner",
    members: [pulumi.interpolate`serviceAccount:${sa.email}`]
});

const saKey = new gcp.serviceaccount.Key("gitlab-key", {
    serviceAccountId; sa.name
});

export const serviceAccountKey = saKey.privateKey;
----

Check the output including secrets with `pulumi stack output serviceAccountKey --show-secrets | base64 -d`.

== DevOps in practice
When using serverless technologies:

* Go native (longer build, no reflection)
* Try CRaC or OpenLiberty for CRIU (Checkpoint/restore in userspace)
* Optimize JVM for it (e.g. setting `-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75) as we want to use as much as resources since we pay for it (by default it is 25%)

Pulumi:

* You don't want to mix deployment and infrastructure.
* Work with Kubernetes:
** Pulumi can both create and deploy to Kubernetes cluster, which Terraform cannot do.
** No more patches and `sed` in Kustomize.
* Pulumi is "backwards-compatible" and "Terraform-friendly":
** Pulumi-Terraform Bridge and Native providers.
** You can convert Terraform and Kubernetes code to Pulumi, so Pulumi can coexist together with Terraform.
