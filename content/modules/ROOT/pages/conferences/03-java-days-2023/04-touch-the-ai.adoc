== Conversation tree

Technologies for conversations:

* IBM Watson
* MS Composer
* Google Dialogflow
    Can be conected to Slack or Messenger

*Benefits*
====
* Speed
* Clarity
* Secure answers
====

*Challenges*
====
* Flow diagram
* Unknown intents
* Huge scope (conversation design) + NLU + time to develop
* Localisation (including broken language)
====

*What business wants?*
====
* More dialogs
* More smalltalk
* More intents, trainings, entities
====

== Generative AI
Mantra: understand, read, write, count, draw, now can see

* 2000s Neural Probabilistic Language Model
* 2017 Transformer Models and Attention Mechanisms
* 2018 BERT
* 2019 GPT-2 and T5
* 2020 GPT-3
* 2021-2022 LaMBDA, xlarge, Chinchilla, CodeGen, InCoder, mGPT, PaLM, OPT-IML, Minerva

Cosine similarity - things are converted to vectors and compared (for similarity)

=== OpenAI

* The goal of OpenAI is a friendly AI to make the word better and support creativity.
* "Give me a sad story" - the story will be sad but ends nicely.
* Training data: Huge language models created by people: Common Crawl, Wikipedia, WebText2, Book1 and Book2.
* GPT = Generative Pre-trained transformer.
* Limited knowledge of internet to June 2021.
* No longer open (no sources available anymore).

=== Gen AI tools

* link:https://chat.openai.com[]
* link:https://perplexity.ai[]
** built on top of ChatGPT
** it can nicely show resources of where the information was used for
* link:https://bard.google.com[]
** It was scared of Europe but can speak Czech now

== Top 5 activities for developers

* Write
** blog article about AI generation
** self yearly evaluation
* summary about the conference
* Conversations
* Summary
* Brainstorming
** I want to increase my salary ideas
* Write emails
* Programming
** Translate from JS to Java or C#
** Describe what the code does
** Code interpreter: Generates Python code to read attached Excel and analyses it (describes and draws data)
* See: Describe a photo
* Integration: Find my insurance contract, find my scheduled meeting from Gmail

== How to implement into business

* Can no longer give information to ChatGPT
** Personal ID (email, phone, photo...)
** IP address, Browser, OS, Device
** Prompt and content
** All conversations including history
** Trainings on my content
** GDPR
** Data storage and processing in the EU

Consumers and enterprises have different needs:

* Consumers (Bard + MakerSuite):
** Plan a 30day trip to Patagonia
** Create a valentine poem
** How to make GF pancakes?
** Create a jazz song for a bday card
* Enterprises (Vertex AI + Duet AI):
** How do we control OUR data
** How do we deal with fraud and security
** How will we control costs
** We need to be accurate and explainable
** How do we integrate our existing data and applications

Gen AI tools + API:

* Google : cloud.google.com/vertex-ai
* Microsoft: oai.azure.com
* OpenAI: platform.openai.com/playground (private training playground)

API:

* Measuring temperature (exactness vs creativity)
* The `completionTokens`, `promptTokens` and `totalToken` are returned to estimate the calculation costs.

=== Use cases:
* Marketing
** Content generator, product description (name, short, long)
** Sentiment Analysis: From ChatBot, comments, social media appstores (traffic light + suggestion)
* Search
** Search on INTERNAL documents, sheets, PDF, images
** Developer documentation on Confluence pages
** Internal system - whisper in customer center
** QnA
** Preparation:
*** Prepare documents
*** What to do when we have 2+ pages
*** Embedding documents
*** Save embedding to vector DB
*** Local, Postgres, AirTable..
** Answering:
*** Get question from user
*** Embedding the question
*** Search in Vector DB (using cosine similarity)
*** Get document
*** Create AI query to LLM (get answer from the document)
*** Send answer and link to document to the user
** Opportunity:
+
> Manager: "No need embedded, Microsoft can select a directory/storage for cognitive search (Azure Cognitive Search) "
+
> Me: "Ok, it is a good way, it will cost 30k USD a month, but I can do cheaper"

* ChatBot and Voice
** HR ChatBot (how many vacation days do I still have)
** Internal Support Bot
** Public Support
** Integrations:
*** Phone: AudioCodes, Avaya, Twilio, Voximplant
*** Dialogflow: Dialog CX, Phone Gateway, Dialogflow, Messenger, Messenger from Facebook, LINE
*** Open source: Google Chat, Azure Bot Service, Microsoft Teams, Discord, ServiceNow, Slack, Spark, Telegram, Twilio, Twitter, Viber
*** Independent integrations: Diagflow API

== Gen AI
* Benefits: Fast and easy to learn, local knowledge, always answers, localisation and data sources
* Challenges: Testing (always different answer), speed, content security, can I trust?

== Automation
* jaRobot.cz: articles written and published by AI
** sometimes too productive
** context-sensitive (speaking in Czech triggers describing Prague for a trip ideas)

== How to start
* ASK people what they want (customer support, marketing, HR)
* SHARE knowledge (AI coffee, virtual regular calls either local or global)
* start WORKING (start to code, MVP, PoC, Hackaton and workshops)
* Do not give up

== QaA
* Author rights: EU wants to accompany AI image with a text that the image is fake. But I think in the future, perhaps the real pictures will signed by blockchain or anything else proving that it was created by human.
