:rating: 4
:pros: A first speaker so far finally thinking over the design at all.
:pros2: Interesting mentions of PostgreSQL design flaw and 1969 Apolo.
:cons: The "ideal solution" of DB transactions is error-prone if the developer forgets `status.commitTransaction()` due to temporal coupling.
:cons2: Most of the examples were rather worthy to beginners. I would appreciate more of the real-life scenarios.

== Story from 20th July 1969

Available on YouTube: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1J2RMorJXM[Light Years Ahead | The 1969 Apollo Guidance Computer]

During landing the error 1202 (similar to Windows blue screen of death or kernel panic in Linux) causing the computer to restart over and over.

Luckily due to telemetry the technician decided they can continue.
AGC (computer) design principles:

* High level language to avoid Assembler (15-bit language)
* No operating system, so they have prioritized jobs instead (landing is more important than anything else at that moment)
* Restart on failure and hardware monitors
* Checkpoint good state that helps to restore the state based on the landing vectors, what activity happens
* Telemetry to send the real data from computer into the NASA base, something like logging

Nowadays, we usually don't predict what can happen and how to save it. The logging is usually insufficient.

== Errors classification and practical examples

The classification is from production

* User errors (though they are not really errors)
* Runtime errors, such a NPE, usually logging prevents it
* Frozen lake, DB connectivity errors etc., these usually don't appear on DEV or TEST environments, which makes these issues unpredictable
* Nightmare, an error that corrupts and destroys data

== Corrupted data

=== Example: Broken transactions

[,adoc]
[plantuml,ab-partial-all-1,svg]
----
Receipt -> ReceiptItem: 1:N
----

Typical transaction model: `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `CREATE RECEIPT`, `CREATE RECEIPT ITEMS` and `COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`

* The receipt items didn't match and were inconsistent.
* The following piece of code was erroneous using Android and SQLite.

[,java]
----
db.beginTransaction();
Receipt receipt = ...;
try {
    db.insert("RECEIPT_TABLE", null, receipt);
    for (ReceiptItem item: receipt.getReceiptItems()) {
        db.insert(RECEIPT_ITEM_TABLE, null, prepareReceiptItem(receipt, item));
    }
    db.setTransactionSuccessful();
} finally {
    db.endTransaction();
}
----

SQLite can commit when a statement in transaction does not succeed, ex. PK violation.
The method `insert` does not throw exception but returns `-1`, the rollback didn't happen and inconsistent data were persisted.
The problem was in the design, though it was documented.

How about this situation without transaction?

The solution is not such easy:

* We have to create receipt items first and then create receipts. In case it fails, there are orphans left, which is no wrong consistency-wise. *But* there are useless data, so...
* In a good will, another developer creates a job to remove orphans. But what if someone hits the time when the job is scheduled? -> Remove only older than 2 hours. *But* what if someone creates an invoice in the future time (Asia where the time is ahead)? So...
* The entire design is wrong and is led by many edge cases.

*Inappropriate* transaction design:
[,java]
----
@Transactional
public void updateReceipt(Receipt receipt) {
    createReceipt(receipt);
    createReceiptItems(receipt);
}
----
Design-wise the annotation is wrong:

* There is not known whether the transaction was started. The behavior should either continue on existing transaction or throw an exception on missing.
* When it works? The method must be `public` and the transaction manager must be configured properly. When the method is `private`, the `@Transactional` method does not work, and it is hard to find out unless we know its prerequisites.

Better design?
[,java]
----
TransactionStatus status = transactionManager.getTransaction(new DefaultTransactionDefinition));
try {
    createReceipt(receipt);
    createReceiptItems(receipt);
    transactionManager.commit(status);
} catch (Exception e) {
    transactionManager.rollback(status);
    throw e;
}
----
But this design is also wrong, for instance if a developer introduces a condition and `return` inside the `try` block:
[,java]
----
// ...
createReceipt(receipt);
createReceiptItems(receipt);
if (discount) {
    processDiscount(receipt);
    return;
}
// ...
----
It is even harder to find this issue in multithreaded environments due to the nature of rows locking.

Ideal design:
[,java]
----
try (DbTransaction.Status = dbTransaction.openNewTransaction()) {
    createReceipt(receipt);
    createReceiptItems(receipt);
    status.commitTransaction();
}
----

=== Example: MySQL with MyISAM storage

Another example of incorrect design is MySQL (MariaDB) storage where InnoDB is  transactional and MyISAM is not.

On requesting a new transaction over the MyISAM storage, the response is that the transaction was created which is misleading.

=== Example: Multithreading

Beware of multiple threads accessing the common resource, ex. Spring beans with common counters:

[,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/counter")
public class CounterApi {
    int counter = 0;

    @RequestMapping(value = "/increase", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public void increaseCounter() {
        counter++;
    }
}
----
The snippet above is wrong and needs to be implemented in the thread-safe way (one of below):

* Good: Wrap the setting and getting with `synchronize (this)`. Beware of `synchronized` that is dangerous and can lead to deadlocks.
* Better: Use `AtomicInteger` that has already synchronized mechanism implemented.

=== Example: Custom cache implementation

It is dangerous to return the reference as it can be modified by the caller and other parts of the program would work with incomplete/corrupted data.

[,java]
----
private final List<Users> usersCache = ...

public List<User> getCachedUsers() {
    return usersCache;                               // this is wrong
    return Collections.unmodifiableList(usersCache); // this is correct
}
----

== Frozen lake

These kind of errors happen after long time in production.
Most common errors:

* API calls and timeouts (DEV mocks are nice, production is not)
* Error-case handling
* Double calling

It is required to use a reasonable timeout and log inputs, outputs, processing time, and suspicious states.

=== Example: API timeouts

A typical case are reports that can take too long time to process beyond the standard report time.

It is a good way to return a promise to the user that we cannot generate report now and that it will be sent via email, so it prevents from requesting further and further reports.

link:https://spoilerproxy.com/[Spoiler Proxy] is a good source to start with microservice testing.

=== Example: Deadlocks

Custom `synchronized` implementation is error-prone to deadlocks.
The `synchronized` block should be as short as possible.

The snippet below almost certainly cause the system to freeze due to large amount of blocked operations.

It also undermines the advantages of multithreading.

[,java]
----
public void calculateData() {
    synchronized (this) {
        File file = readFromFile();
        CalculatedData data = processAndCalculate(file);
        saveResult(data);
    }
}
----

The `@Transactional` annotation becomes also problematic as it locks the records during the long REST API call (timeouts are usually set in seconds).

[,java]
----
public void calculateData() {
    Data data = readFromDatabase();
    updateUser();
    callRemoteApi(data);
}
----

Solutions:

* Application design should be simple (KISS) and we should think "what if..."
* Log all suspicious states, inconsistencies, slow operations...
* Actively trace and resolve a strange error that happens once a week.

== Runtime errors

Java has a robust system of exception handling.

What we want to know?

* The error occurred from logs before the user reports it.
* The whole stacktrace.
* The additional information (user ID, mobile application ID, ...)
* The parameters the request was called (beware of logging the sensitive information)
* The flow of the API calls.

Solution:

* Unique request ID, for example UUID, that is also displayed to the user that can report it and send to other APIs in a header
* Use Kibana (ELK) for tracing:
** Beats and Logstash parse data
** Elasticsearch is a database
** Kibana is the UI
* Request context using `ThreadLocal` which is better over `@Scope(value = WebApplicationContext.SCOPE_REQUEST)` because it is limited to HTTP servlet (so jobs would not work).
+
[,java]
----
@AllArgsConstructor
@Getter
public class RequestContext {

    private final String requestId;
    private final UserId userId;
    private final Locale locale;
    private final boolean testMode;
}
----
+
[,java]
----
@Service
public class RequestContextService {

    private final ThreadLocal<RequestContext> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public void attachRequestContext(RequestContext requestContext) {
        threadLocal.set(requestContext);
    }

    public void detachRequestContext() {
        threadLocal.remove();
    }

    public RequestContext getRequestContext() {
        return threadLocal.get();
    }
}
----

=== Example: Incorrect exception handling

Few horrible examples:

- The error that will never happen will eventually happen:
+
[,java]
----
try {
    updateUser();
} catch (Exception e) {
    // this will never happen
}
----
- The thrown exception ignores the cause and the information is lost:
+
[,java]
----
try {
    updateUser();
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected error");
}
----

It is a good practice to enrich the thrown exception:

. {empty}
+
[,java]
----
throw new RuntimeException("Cannot update user: " + userName + " " + e.getMessage(), e);
----
. Catch the error in a central `ExceptionHandler` and add RequestId, UserId, IP address, UserAgent, URI, etc.

TIP: Include a space between the outputs `user: Nikolas` otherwise Kibana would not find it.

Java design is odd:

* `IOException` is checked though should be unchecked it is unnecessary as it can happen anytime while working with DB, disk, network, etc.
* `NumberFormatException` is unchecked though should be checked as it is commonly handled.

== User errors

* User inserts incorrect data so we need to validate them.
* Distinguish between user and system errors.
* Beware of logins and do not use `ERROR` for user inputs.
* Use HTTP return codes correctly, for example 400 Bad Request and 500 Internal Server Error. Try to avoid 404 Not Found.
* Localize the error message.
* It is a good practice to distinguish the errors using `Exception` subclasses, for example `throw new UserException("error.user.invalidUserNameOrPassword");`.
