APIs are everywhere, modern applications are based on APIs (Mobile, Web, IoT, Backend-to-backend), so it is a magnet for attackers and is a possible security risk.

Risks:

* Sensitive data can be exposed to unauthorized person.
* Stolen money from bank account.
*Complete airplane booked (then canceled to lower price).
* Attach can cause serious damage (IoT).
* DDoS attacks ruins our business which cannot offer services anymore
* We can have higher costs for cloud (or other paid) services, for example mailing service

== Basic concepts

*Identity*: Each user has a visible identity which is a set of contextual attributes:

* Person: name, email, phone, picture
** This can also change by context: Work identity (name, employee number, department), Social network identity (name, email, avatar), Game identity (name, nickname, rank)
* Device: ID, IP address, model, version
* Application
* Component

*Authentication* defines *who* you are. For example a citizen of EU based on the ID card or passport matching your biometry.

*Authorization* defines *what* rights you have. For example, members of the EU countries can enter the EU with no limit, though most of the countries need visa = *claim*.

*Access Policy Enforcement* is a verification policy, for example checking the visa authenticity and expiration.

*Authority* issues and verifies tokens, and user identity, and guarantees the information in the tokens are valid.

== Centralized IAM (Identity Management)

If a system provides multiple application where each requires an access, it is not convenient to require the user to register into each one -> This resolves SSO, but the API gateway needs to verify tokens across the *n* applications -> Centralized IAM that all applications integrate to, including the API Gateway.

* User has one set of login credentials improving the user experience
* SSO is relative easy to implement via centralized ADM
* Central point assures consistency of the identity-related data
* Integration to external providers
* Single point of failure, so it has to be secured

=== OAuth 2.0

Standardized IAM solution created for delegated *Authorization* scenarios, follows the IETF standard and defines authorization flows.
It enables an application to obtain authorization to call APIs:

* Application can obtain User's consent to call APIs on User's behalf.
* Application can obtain authorization to call APIs on its own behalf.

It *does not* deal with identities themselves and *is not* an authentication protocol -> Open ID Connect solves it.

=== Open ID Connect

It provides an identity service layer on top of OAuth 2.0 as a federated *Authentication* protocol that allows user to reuse their accounts and can integrate multiple identity providers.
It allows auth server to authenticate user for applications in a standard way and enables an application to delegate user authentication to OAuth 2.0 auth server.
It supports SSO.

Open ID Connect is a successor to SAML.

- Relying on party = OAuth 2.0 Client (client application which requests claims about user
- Open ID Provider = OAuth 2.0 Authorization server (authorization as a service: issues identity tokens)

=== Tokens

*Access Token* is a token used by an application to access an API.
It represents the application's authorization to call an API and has an expiration.

*Refresh Token* is an optional token that can be used bu an application to request a new access token when a prior access token has expired.

*Authentication Code* is an intermediary, opaque code returned to the application and used to obtain an access token and optionally refresh token. Each authorization code is used once.

*Json Web Tokens (JWT)* is a JSON structure  which encodes claims, where claim is value asserted about subject. The structure is `{header}.{payload}.{signature}` and the standard registered claims are:

* `jti` - token identifier
* `iss` - token issuer (issuer)
* `sub` - token principal identification (subject)
* `aud` - recipients of a token (audience)
* `exp` - token expiration time

=== Keycloak

It is the open source customizable and extendable IAM solution and authorization server.
It supports the latest standard protocols with fine-grained authorization capabilities.

* User authentication (SSO support)
* OpenID/SAML 2.0 identity provider
* High availability, scalability, multi-tenancy support
* Identity brokering and social login
* User federation support (LDAP, AD, Kerberos, ...)

Alternatives:

* Auth0
* Curity
* Amazon IAS

== Spring Security

Spring security provides modules to support OAuth 2.0, Open ID Connect, and JWT.

Postman serves as an API client.

=== Keycloak

Keycloak can define realms that serve as sandboxes.

*Client* defines a client with parameters, such as URLs and Authentication flow from the OAuth 2.0 protocol point of view:

** *Standard flow* is the most secure and most used
** *Implicit flow* is not as secured as the standard flow
** *Direct access grants* makes the authorization server to grant the access token directly.
Each client also has own *Client Secret* for communication with Keycloak.

In a simple case, it is needed to register Postman (Root and Home URLs are `localhost:8080`).

=== API implementation

.`build.gradle`
[,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
}
----

.`SecurityConfig.java`
[,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http.authorizeHttpRequests(authorize -> authorize
            // Authorize using matchers
            //.requestMatchers("/api/*").hasAuthority("ROLE_USER")
            //.requestMatchers("/api/*").hasRole("ROLE_ADMIN")
            .anyRequest().authenticated())
        // Spring by default cannot decode roles from Keycloak
        .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2
            .jwt(jwt -> jwt.jwtAuthenticationConverter(new KeycloakJwtAuthenticationConverter()))
        );
        return http.build();
    }
}
----

Either use matchers above or declarative authorization below:

.`ApiController.java`
[,java]
----
@GetMapping(path = "/hello")
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_USER') or 'hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
public String helloWorld() { .. }

@GetMapping(path = "/admin/hello")
@PreAuthorize("'hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
public String adminHelloWorld() { .. }
----

It is needed to show Spring where is Keycloak server.
Spring automatically uses its public key.

.`application.properties`
[,properties]
----
spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:8090/realms/javadays
debug=true
----

On top of that, Spring Security provides the following:

* Access Token validation
* Token Claims mapping
* Declarative Access Control

=== API call

Postman OAuth 2.0 authorization:

* Token Name - any token name
* Grant type - Authorization Code
* Callback URL - `http://localhost:8080` (unused in this case)
* Authorize using browser - false
* Auth URL - `http://localhost:8080/realms/javadays/protocol/openid-connect/auth` (Keycloak, authentication server)
* Access Token URL - `http://localhost:8080/realms/javadays/protocol/openid-connect/token` (Keycloak, token issuer)
* Client ID - `postman` as registered in Keycloak
* Client secret - Generated for client ID in Keycloak
* Scope - profile email openid (Keycloak will insert `id_token` into the access token with the authentication information as a proof of identity)
* State - null
* Client Authentication - Send client credentials in body

Only the authorization server can ask the password, not the application itself.

Upon requesting "Get New Access Token", Postman gets redirected to Keycloak login page.

=== Open Policy Agent

It is a policy-based control for cloud native environments.

== Conclusion

Implement proper authentication and authorization using standards and best practices:

* OAuth 2.0 and Open ID Connect
* JWT
* Encryption
* Opaque Tokens
* API design
* Do not implement what is available (products, frameworks, ...)
* Include security tests and monitor the system
