:pros: Extremely useful overview of upcoming features mentioning `RestClient` and `JdbcClient`.

We celebrate 20 years of Spring Framework and 10 years of Spring Boot.
The biggest importance is BOM of common dependencies because Spring defines
version of libraries that work together and are also safe security-wise (use latest patches, etc.)

== Dates and Timeline

* Jakarta EE
** Jakarta EE 9 is just packaging changes with renames `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` causing big-bang and a lot of libraries weren't ready
** Jakarta EE 10 brings improvements.
** Jakarta EE 11 will bring Servlet 6.1 and JPA 3.2
* JDK 17 - Records, Text blocks, NPE messages, AArch64 (it is usually a cheaper alternative)
* JDK 21 - Virtual Threads, SequenceCollections, Default charset is `UTF-8`, Linux/RISC-V

Spring Boot 3 has not released a statement whether it is officially supporting JDK 21, though it can run on top of it but use no features.

* Spring Boot 3.2.X and Spring Framework 6.1.X will be released in Dec 2023.
* Spring Boot 2.6.X and Spring Framework 5.2.X will stop being supported as of Jan 2024.
* After 2025, it will be necessary to either migrate to Spring Boot 2.7.X (Spring 5.3.X) or Spring Boot 3.1.X/3.2.X (Spring 6.1.X).

== News in Spring Framework 6

* Start-up optimization.
** GraalVM + native image, Spring AOT.
** JVM Checkpoint Restore (CRaC).
* Virtual Threads as of JDK 21.
* WebFlux (Reactive): They filled the gaps.
* Micrometer & Observability.
* Data Binding & Validation simplified and cleaned.

=== GraalVM + Native Image

== Pros and Cons

*Pros*:
====
* Extremely fast startup, saves memory 2x-5x, similar speed as JVM in runtime (might be a bit slower)
====

*Cons*:
====
* Very slow compilation in terms of minutes
* No dynamic class loading
* Explicitly listed: reflection, proxy, serialization
* No changes to beans (only properties change)
* Kills Spring profiles (need for multiple layers)
* Fixed x86_64, AArch64 processor type
====

*Spring AOT*:

* Ahead-of-time preprocessing of Spring ApplicationContext
* `@Conditional` must be evaluated in advance
* Eliminates most of reflection
* Pre-generating proxies

=== JVM Checkpoint Restore (CRac)

This is more sound to developers than GraalVM.

* JDK 21 and Spring Framework 6.1 and Spring Boot 3.2
* Checkpoint -> Snapshot (something like hibernation) -> Restore
* Container/Bean Lifecycle revisited since Srping 3.X
** Release of OS resources on snapshot (file handles, sockets, hWND,...)
** ApplicationContext (`start()`, `stop()`, `restart()` - this brings callback to restore beans)
** `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` & `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler`
* Results (Spring integrates it): https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-checkpoint-restore-smoke-tests

*Pros*
====
* Very fast startup
* Flexibility of JVM
====

*Cons*
====
* Linux only (similar to Docker)
* Manual lifecycle management for manual resources (open files, sockets...)
* Sensitive data leak to snapshot (passwords, keys -> possible update config when restart)
====

== Future: Spring Framework 6.2

Project Leyden as a proof of concept for faster bootstrap in HotSpot.
Spring supports this but it is too early.
Class data sharing -> one computer more JVM can share the same classes (JVM classes for now but they think of enabling to client libraries -> Spring is interested in it).

=== Virtual threads

* Improvements for Spring MVC (embedded Tomcat and Jetty), so each request will not have own thread, because now the threads are blocking I/O,
* Virtual threads must not be pooled
* Improves imperative programming for better scalability (Servlet, Spring MVC, JDBC drivers).
* `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` -> `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` and `ThreadPoolTaskScheduler` -> `SimpleAsyncTaskScheduler`
* Spring Boot:
** Executors can use virtual threads by default (`spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true`)
** Embedded Tomcat & Embedded Jetty can use virtual threads.

=== WebFlux / Reactive improvements

* Filling the gaps:
** Support for `CompletableFuture` everywhere
** Async Cache SPI (built on `CompletableFuture`)
** Scheduling with reactive types
** Better support for Kotlin Coroutines
* `WebClient`
** Added adapter on top of JDK `HttpClient` (`JdkClientHttpConnector`) as of Spring 6.1.X  in addition to Apache HttpComponents, Reactor Netty, etc.

=== Other improvements

* `HttpStatus` will become `class` instead of `enum`.
* `RestClient` is a non-reactor sibling to `WebClient` as a fluent API replacement for `RestTemplate` (get rid of tons of overloaded methods).
* `JdbcClient` as a replacement for JdbcTemplate as a fluent API (get rid of tons of overloaded methods).

=== HTTP interface clients

* Introduced `@HttpExchange` repository interfaces (inspired by Spring Data repositories).
* HttpServiceProxyFactory generates Client proxies based on `RestClient`.

[,java]
----
@HttpExchange
interface BookRepository {

    @GetExchange("/books")
    List<Book> getBooks();

    @GetExchange("/books/{id}")
    Book getBook(@PathVariable long id);

    @PostExchange("/books")
    Book svaeBook(@RequestBody Book book);

    @DeleteExchange("/books/{id}")
    ResponseEntity<Void> deleteBook(@PathVariable long id);
}
----

== News in Spring Boot 3

* Focuses a lot on start-up that if slow is an obstacle for cloud.
* BOM = Boot starters updated to newest major versions.
* Spring Boot 2.7 -> Spring Security 5.7 (supports Spring Security 5.8)
* Spring Boot 3.0 -> Spring Security 6.0
* Log4J2 extension enables profile specific configuration: `log4j2-profileName.xml`

=== Micrometer

* Micrometer Observability API & Micrometer Tracing is like Slf4j for moniforing
* Observability API: `ObservationRegistry`, `@Observed` aspect, `Observation.Context` (hold tags)
* Distributed tracing context propagation: Across multiple apps, log correlation, support for W3C context propagation (to tag observations)
* Spring Boot auto-configuration can enable things above

=== Support for Docker Compose
* You can run PostgreSQL along with the app.
* Improved support for Testcontainers: `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.service.connection.ConnectionDetails`: DB connection configuration is not from `application.properties` files but obtained programatically by `ConnectionDetails` implementation (source properties, Docker compose, Testcontainers, possibly in the future AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.)

=== Spring OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server

Complements Spring Security OAuth 2.0:

* Client
* Resource Server (Web app)
* **Authorization server** (Token server) is a *new* Spring feature.

== Migration

See link:https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-3.0-Migration-Guide[Spring Boot 3.0 Migration Guide].

* Upgrade Jakarta EE 10 -> Big bang 💀
* Upgrade to OpenJDK 21 (LTS) 🎉, perhaps forget about OpenJDK 17 (LTS)
* Maintain old libraries for OpenJDK 11 (LTS) - Gradle toolchains (Maven does not support it)
* Since Spring Boot 2.7
** `META-INF/spring.factories` property `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration` changed to:
*** `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.Autoconfiguration.imports`
*** `META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.web.ManagementContextConfiguration.imports`
* Spring Boot Property Migrator: `org.springframework.boot`:`spring=boot-properties-migrator` flags old properties and works well with IntelliJ IDEA.
