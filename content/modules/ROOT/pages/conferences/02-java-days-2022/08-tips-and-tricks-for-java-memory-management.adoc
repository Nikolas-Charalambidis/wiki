:pros: Educative session about how JVM memory management is done in sufficient detail.
:cons: I expected more "tips and tricks," especially ineffective code snippets and how to fix them.

Cases when `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` occurs:

* It's not possible to allocate a new instance of an object, because the memory runs out in the Heap.
* A huge array is allocated that doesn't fit in the memory.
* Native memory ran out in the Metaspace.
* Allocation of memory failed on native code call through JNI
* High overhead of Garbage Collector (GC)
* By default, if Garbage Collector takes 98% or more of the JVM run and deallocates less than 5% of memory, the error is thrown
* It's not possible to create a new thread, because the underlying OS limits the maximum number of threads (this surprisingly throws this error as JVM does not have much information from the OS).

Cases when `java.lang.StackOverflowError` occurs:

* Excessive deep or infinite recursion.

== JVM memory management

=== Heap
Heap contains object allocation, array allocation, String pool, GC, etc.
The Heap is divided into 2 basic sections:

* Young Generation (Eden + Survival)
* Old Generation

The GC checks the younger objects more often than the survival and old ones.

Most of the problems are related to Heap and Non-Heap: Although the overall memory allocated of the Heap is sufficient, `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` is thrown when a single section gets full.
For example, it doesn't matter if the remaining sections are nearly empty if the Eden section is full.

=== Non-Heap
Internal data used by the JVM that are invisible to a developer (code cache, formerly Permanent Generation (PermGen), now Metaspace).

=== Stack
There are 2 types of stacks: A Native Stack (for native and JNI methods) and a Normal Stack (for our methods). Each thread has its stack.

Method calls and metadata storage. Each frame has: Return value, local variables, operand stack, and current class constant pool reference (into the Non-Heap memory).

== Garbage Collector (GC)
The Heap memory is hierarchically divided by young/old generation and further sub-groups for the optimized and fairly sophisticated run.

General garbage collecting algorithms overview:
* **Tracing (Reachability tree):** The GC traverses the oriented graph of objects, traces for the reachable ones, and removes the unreachable ones. Though this algorithm is slow and expensive but can detect and remove cyclical references. JVM GC uses this algorithm.
* **Reference counting:** Counts the number of references and removes if fall to zero. This algorithm can miss cyclical references.

By default, the less memory is available, the more aggressively the GC runs to release the memory in the JVM.
This approach delays  `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`, though the overhead of the GC run raises and the application becomes less responsive (lags).

== String internization

String internization is implemented using the flyweight design pattern (referencing a shared copy).
String literals (those between "") are interned (pooled) automatically. Though we can call String#intern, it's not recommended for the short-lived strings as we risk wasting memory.
It's also not a good idea to intern the sensitive data as it's not under our control when they are removed from the memory by the GC. For this reason, all sensitive content should be passed through `char[]`.

== Java 8 changes to the JVM
* Permanent Generation is replaced by a more dynamic Metaspace. It caused problems with multiple hot-deploy (ex. Tomcat, etc.) when the JVM is not registered. Though a new classloader is loaded and the reference to the old one is discarded and the class references become replaced by the new one, releasing the long-living classes takes a delay (if they are released at all) and the maximum memory limit can be hit.
* Permanent Generation (PermGen) has a fixed size of an allocated continuous block of native memory in the OS that is not efficiently deallocated.
** `-XX:PermSize=[size]`
** `-XX:MaxPermSize=[size]`.
* Metaspace has a dynamically allocated memory continuous block of native memory in the OS that is efficiently deallocated as long as the OS only limits how much memory is can be provided.
** `-XX:MetaspaceSize=[size]`
** `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=[size]`
** `-XX=MinMetaspaceFreeRatio=[ratio]`
** `-XX:MaxMetaspaceFreeRatio=[ratio]`

== Memory management problems

=== Resolving

* Generate a memory dump for further analysis:
** `jmap -dump:[live],format=b,file=<file=path> <pid>`
** `jcmd <pid> GC.heap_dump <file-path>`
** `java -XX:+HeatDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`
+
The biggest issue is that the application can become iresponsive before OutOfMemoryError is thrown and the critical moment is missed.

* Restart the application:
** java -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError
** java -XX+CrashOnOutOfMemoryError
** java -XX:OnOutOfMemoryError="stop.sh %p"
** Use the monitoring tools: JMX, Jolokia, https://gceasy.io/ for gc.log analysis.

=== Prevention

* Analyse the memory management on the production run (take off-peak load memory dumps to find out irregularities).
* Don't forget to do performance testing.
* Optimize JVM to not use too big Heap which increases the GC overhead.
* Minimize the memory demand:
* Minimize stateful integration and HTTP session usage.
* Make the application stateless.
* Beware of soft/weak references in the cache and the size of the keys (it is not a good idea to put a whole request as a key).
* A large number of hash-based structures (HashMap and HashSet) is also not a good idea and a plain array can be a better choice.
* VisualVM is a nice tool but favors smaller Heap sized.
