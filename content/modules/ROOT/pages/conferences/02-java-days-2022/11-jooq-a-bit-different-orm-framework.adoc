:rating: 4
:pros: Amazing introduction to jOOQ so I would love to try it out immediately. GitHub copilot.
:cons: The transaction management (commits, rollbacks) was not explained at all as well as triggers, procedures, etc. though the session was more than rich enough.

jOOQ `/Ê¤uk/` stands for "jOOQ Object Oriented Querying" and is a Java framework for database integration introducing type-safe and database platform-independent SQL queries.
It does *not* hide the SQL queries, unlike Hibernate, it only makes them easier to use.

[,sql]
----
SELECT last_name, first_name FROM user
WHERE role = 'admin'
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(USER.LAST_NAME, USER.FIRST_NAME)
    .from(USER)
    .where(USER.ROLE.eq("admin"))
    .orderBy(USER.LAST_NAME, USER.FIRST_NAME);
----

== Database integration solutions comparison

=== JPA/Hibernate

**Advantages:**

* Database platform-independent SQL.
* Suitable for CRUD operations and persisting complex object graphs.

**Disadvantages:**

* Extremely complex, difficult, and error-prone (lazy fetch, 1-N queries...).
* Not suitable for complex queries across multiple tables and the following need to be used: JPQL/HQL, Criteria API, QueryDSL (though we know how the SQL should look like, it's not easy to write it with QueryDSL), native queries...
* Cannot be used if the database structure is not known in advance.

=== JDBC

**Advantages:**

* Enables the full power of the SQL: useful if the database structure is not known in advance.

**Disadvantages:**

* Low-level API that is not database platform-independent and the SQL queries must follow a dialect.
* No type-safety and prone to SQL injection.

=== Spring JdbcTemplate

**Advantages:**

* Enables the full power of the SQL: useful if the database structure is not known in advance.
* More comfortable API than a pure JDBC.

**Disadvantages:**

* No type safety and no not database platform independence.
* Errors in complex queries are rather discovered in runtime.

=== jOOQ

**Advantages:**

* Enables the full power of the SQL: useful if the database structure is not known in advance.

**Disadvantages:**

* Not suitable for persisting complex object graphs.
* The free version works only for the latest versions of open-source databases.

== Approaches

=== Database-first

The database is a source of truth and the code is generated from it. This approach is preferred as the database changes less often than the code.

Developers need to design the data structure and the database becomes more efficiently used.

A code generator produces a Java/Kotlin type-safe code with the database description: tables, sequences, stored procedures, indexes, records

**Type safety:**

[,java]
----
dslc.select(USER.LAST_NAME, USER.FIRST_NAME)
    .from(USER)
    .where(USER.ROLE.eq(1)) // the USER.ROLE is of the type VARCHAR â†’ compiler-time error
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(USER.LAST_NAME, USER_FIRSTNAME) // the USER.LAST_NAME was renamed to USER.SURNAME â†’ compiler-time error
    .from(USER)
    .where(USER.ROLE.eq("admin"));
----

=== Generator-first

It's possible to use jOOQ even without the code generator, though it is not recommended.

It's useful in case the database structure is not known in advance.

**No type safety:**

[,java]
----
dslc.select(field("last_name"), field("first_name"))
    .from(table("user"))
    .where(field("role").eq("admin"))
    .orderBy(field("last_name"), field("first_name"));
----

== Quick start

Start with the [`DSL`](https://www.jooq.org/javadoc/dev/org.jooq/org/jooq/impl/DSL.html) to get `DSLContext` which is the main object for writing the queries.

[,java]
----
var dslc = DSL.using(connection, SQLDialect.POSTGRES);
var dslc = DSL.using(dataSource, SQLDialect.POSTGRES);
----

Spring Boot offers `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-jooq` to configure and inject the context.

== Queries

=== WHERE

[,java]
----
dslc.select(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME)
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .where(
        (AUTHOR.LAST_NAME.eq("London").or(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME.like("J%"))
        .and(AUTHOR.YEAR_OF_BIRTH.between(1800, 1900))
    );
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME)
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .where(
        AUTHOR.LAST_NAME.eq("London").or(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME.like("J%")),
        AUTHOR.YEAR_OF_BIRTH.between(1800, 1900)));
----

=== JOIN

Join is supported as well as all common joins (`INNER`, `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL OUTER`, `CROSS`) and introduces *semi* and *anti* joins.

[,java]
----
dslc.select(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, BOOK.TITLE)
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .join(BOOK).on(AUTHOR.ID.eq(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID))
    .where(AUTHOR.ID.eq(1));
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, BOOK.TITLE)
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .join(BOOK).onKey() // in case the foreign key is well-configured
    .where(AUTHOR.ID.eq(1));
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(BOOk.author().LAST_NAME, AUTHOR.author().FIRST_NAME, BOOK.TITLE) // jOOQ can do an implicit JOIN
    .from(BOOK)
    .where(AUTHOR.ID.eq(1));
----

=== Semi-JOIN

Semi-join returns all the left-side rows for which there *exists* at least one right-sided row. It's a kind of "fake" join as it finds out whether there is something to join.

[,java]
----
dslc.select(BOOK.TITLE).from(BOOK)
    .leftSemiJoin(BOOK_TO_BOOK_STORE).onKey();
----
[,sql]
----
SELECT book.title FROM BOOK
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM book_to_book_store
    WHERE book_to_book_store.book_id = book.id)
----
[,java]
----
// alternative using jOOQ without the semi-join
dslc.select(BOOK.TITLE).from(BOOK)
    .whereExists(
        dslc.selectOne()
            .from(BOOK_TO_BOOK_STORE)
            .where(BOOK_TO_BOOK_STORE.BOOK_ID.eq(BOOK.ID)));
----

=== Anti-JOIN

Anti-join is an opposite to *semi join*. Returns all the left-side rows for which there *doesn't exist* at least one right-sided row.
[,java]
----
dslc.select(BOOK.TITLE).from(BOOK)
.leftAntiJoin(BOOK_TO_BOOK_STORE).onKey();
----

== Aggregation

[,java]
----
dslc.select(count()).from(BOOK);
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(avg(BOOK.YEAR_OF)).from(BOOK);
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(LANGUAGE.DESCRIPTION, count())
    .from(BOOK).join(LANGUAGE).onKey()
    .gropuBy(LANGUAGE.DESCRIPTION)
    .orderBy(count()).desc();
----

== Complex queries

[,sql]
----
SELECT author.first_name, author.last_name, count(*) FROM author
    JOIN book ON book.author_id = author.id
    JOIN language ON book.language_id = language.id
WHERE lanuage.code = 'CZ' AND book.published_in > DATE '2020-01-01'
GROUP BY author.first_name, author.last_name
HAVING count(*) > 5
ORDER BY author.last_name ASC NULLS FIRST
LIMIT 5 OFFSET10;
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, count()).from(AUTHOR)
    .join(BOOK).onKey()
    .join(LANGUAGE).onKey()
    .where(LANGUAGE.CODE.eq("CZ").and(BOOK.PUBLISHED_IN.gt(LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1))))
    .groupBy(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME)
    .having(count().gt(5))
    .orderBy(AUTHOR.LAST_NAME.asc().nullsFirst())
    .limit(5).offset(10);
----

== Reading

**Single line:** `fetchOne` returns one or `null` or exception in case of more rows, `fetchSingle` returns exactly one row or exception in case of more rows, `fetchAny` returns one or `null` and ignores the rest in case of more rows.

**Multiple lines:** `fetch` returns a `List`, `fetchLazy` returns a cursor (similar to JDBC `ResultSet`), `stream` returns Java 8 Stream, `fetchGroups`, `fetchMap`, `fetchArray`...

=== POJO mapping using the column names via reflection

It can be sufficient in many cases.
[,java]
----
dslc.select(BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE).from(BOOK)
    .fetchInto(Book::class);
----

=== POJO mapping using the constructors

This is type-safe.
[,java]
----
dslc.select(BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE.as("bookTitle")).from(BOOK)
    .fetch(Records.mapping(Book::new));
----

== Writing

=== Using SQL

[,java]
----
dslc.insertInto(AUTHOR, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAT_NAME)
    .values("Jack", "London")
    .execute();
----
[,java]
----

dslc.update(AUTHOR)
    .set(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, "Jack")
    .where(AUTHOR.ID.eq(3))
    .execute();
----
[,java]
----
dslc.delete(AUTHOR)
    .where(AUTHOR.ID.eq(100))
    .execute();
----

=== Using record pattern

[,java]
----
// CREATE
var book = dslc.newRecord(BOOK);
book.setTitle("1984");
book.store();
// ID is autogenerated and populated automatically
var bookId = book.getId();
// RETRIEVE
var book2 = dslc.fetchSingle(BOOK, BOOK.ID.eq(bookId));
// UPDATE
book2.setPublishedIn(2000);
book2.store();
// DELETE
book2.delete();
----

=== Generated POJO and DAO

[,java]
----
var book = new Book();
book.setTitle("1984");
bookDao.insert(book);
// ID is autogenerated and populated automatically
var bookId = book.getId();
// RETRIEVE
var book2 = bookDao.fetchOneById(bookId);
bookDao.update(book2);
// DELETE
bookDao.delete(book2);
----

== Complex features

=== Emulation of non-existing database functions

For example, PostgreSQL doesn't know `median`.
[,sql]
----
SELECT percentile_cont(0.5) WITHING GROUP (ORDER BY book.published_in) FROM book;
----
[,java]
----
dslc.select(median(BOOK.PUBLISHED_IN)).from(BOOK); // there is no PostgreSQL median
----

=== Enumerations

Database-native enums can be mapped to the Java `enum`. Hibernate struggles with PostgreSQL enumerations.

[,sql]
----
CREATE TYPE book_type AS ENUM ('NOVEL', 'POEM', 'ESSAY'); -- PostgreSQL enumerations
----
[,java]
----
dslc.celect(BOOK.TITLE).from(BOOK).where(BOOK.TYPE.eq(BookTypeEnum.NOVEL));
----

=== Native database arrays

Database-native arrays can be mapped to the Java array.

[,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE book (
   tags text[]
);
----
[,java]
----
public class Book implements Serializable { // jOOQ generated class
    private String[] tags;
    // getters and setters
}
----

=== Nested data structures

They are supported in jOOQ, though Hibernate excels in it.

Sadly, only H2 and PostgreSQL database support native arrays (the method `array` can be used), though in other database types the method `multiset` is a proper substitution for `array`.

[,java]
----
public record Book(int id, String title) {}
public record Name(String first, String last) {}
public record Author(int id, Name name, Book[] books) {}
----
[,java]
----
// this generates duplicated author first and surnames and requires further processing in Java
dslc.select(AUTHOR.ID, AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME, BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE)
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .join(BOOK).onKey()
    .fetch();
----
[,java]
----
// column mapping
dslc.select(
        AUTHOR.ID,
        row(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME).as("name"))
        array(
            dslc.select(row(BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE))
                .from(BOOK)
                .where(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID.eq(AUTHOR_ID))).as("books"))
                .from(AUTHOR)
    .fetchInto(Author::class);
----
[,java]
----
// constructor mapping
dslc.select(
        AUTHOR.ID,
        row(AUTHOR.FIRST_NAME, AUTHOR.LAST_NAME).mapping(Name::new))
        array(
            dslc.select(row(BOOK.ID, BOOK.TITLE))
                .mapping(Book::class, Book::new)
                .from(BOOK)
                .where(BOOK.AUTHOR_ID.eq(AUTHOR_ID)))
    .from(AUTHOR)
    .fetchInto(Author::class);
----

=== Format as JSON
[,java]
----
var jsonFormat = new JSONFORMAT()
    .recordFormat(JSONFormat.RecordFormat.OBJECT)
    .format(true);
System.out.println(query.fetch().formatJSON(jsonFormat));
----

=== Format as an ASCII table

It is useful for debugging due to the well-overridden `Object#toString` method.
[,java]
----
System.out.println(query.fetch());
----

=== Other features

The main use case is for a dynamic approach to the database, it can generate procedures, triggers, etc. It has a rich API over the databases.

Migration scripts are recommended to use and work well with jOOQ.

Works well with Hibernate and those can be combined over the same transaction manager. This approach is also recommended to combine various use cases where each framework excels.

=== Problems with Kotlin generators

* KotlinGenerator generates in POJO types of all database columns as nullable (correct in the principle, but troublesome in practice).
* The solution should come with the 3.18 version.
* An alternative is the JavaGenerator with `@Nullable` and `@NotNull`.

== jOOQ dual license model

* **OpenSource** version is for free for the latest open source DB versions (PostgreSQL, MySQL...).
* **Paid version** (99â‚¬, 399â‚¬, and 999â‚¬ per developer per year depending on the obscurity of the database) has no further fees (application, server) and supports older open source database versions as well as other non-open source databases. The paid subscription includes support.
