:quote: The Oracle Java is again available free of charge for production as of Java 17.

:rating: 2
:pros: A nice and brief overview of the new and incoming technologies and upgrades as well as an overview of the usage statistics from various sources.
:cons: Though it is nice to know which JRE/JDK distribution the speaker prefers, no technical reasoning was provided instead.
:cons2: So much hate towards MySQL but no explanation.
:cons3: It's nice to know what offers a "killer feature", but what exactly it is? Next time less of hype, swag, and buzzwords, but more explanation.

** The best distributions: Adoptium (Temurin) which is TCK certified and GraalVM for native applications.
** The Generic OpenJDK has half-year validity only
** Oracle Java is again available free of charge for production under the new "Oracle No-Fee Terms and Conditions" (NFTC) license that reverses a 2018 decision. This applies to the recently released version 17 of Oracle JDK and future versions.

* Java EE is no longer used in favor of Jakarta EE, which means no longer `javax` packages but the `jakarta` ones.
* Spring Security 6 has a major change where `SecurityChainFilter` has to be used instead of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
* Spring Data JPA and Hibernate 6
* AOT GraalVM support for native images making Spring Native obsolete as it was an experimental project, not it is supported out-of-the-box.

== Java 18
* Multiline String.
* Switch Expressions.
* Records.
* Pattern Matching for `instanceof`.
