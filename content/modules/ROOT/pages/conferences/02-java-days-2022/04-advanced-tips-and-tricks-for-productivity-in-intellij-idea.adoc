:pros: Perfect tips I didn't know about and I will surely use: Especially from the navigation section, and String manipulation. Suggested very plugins.
:cons: I expected more of the debugging tricks.
:cons2: RIP for the Mac users  as only Windows shortcuts were presented (though the speaker is a Windows user, he could include them.

== Navigation

* Type hierarchy (**⌃H**).
* Last edit location (**⌘⇧⌫**).
* Backward-forward location history (**⌥⌘←** / **⌥⌘→**).
* Quick documentation view (**⌥␣**)(works also for XML, Dockerfile, in Windows **ctrl**+**Q**).
* Find a test class or method for implementation (**⌘⇧T**).
* Other: File structure, Declaration, and usages...

== Opening and Reading

* Multicolumn edit (Mouse Middle button, or **⌥⌘⇧** and left click and drag).
* Multiple carets (**⌥⇧** and click)
* Quick open understands wildcard (**⇧⇧** and type `*Controller`).
* Other: Mnemonic bookmarks, Find in the previous search (for example `pet` AND `@Entity`).

== Debugging

* Node.js debugging (**⌃⇧** click to the `localhost` address once the application starts).
* Debug evaluation in a full-text mode can define new variables and return them to the console (a log trick can be used with a raw `List`):
+
[,java]
----
int a = 5;
int b = a + 5;
a
----
This prints out the value of `a` only.
* Other: Remote debug (`ssh -f nikolas@email.com -L 5005:127.0.0.1:5005 -N`).

== Code Writing

* Live templates are context-aware (`sout`, `iter`, `psvm`, `for`, `lazy`).
* Surround with code (`if-else`, `try-catch`, etc.)(**⌘⌥T**).
* Show context actions (**⌥↵**).
* Delete line (**⌘X**).
* Duplicate line (**⌘D**).
* Move lines up or down (**⌥⇧↑** / **⌥⇧↓**).
* Move blocks up or down (**⌘⇧↑** / **⌘⇧↓**).

== Plugins
* Presentation assistant plugin to show the shortcuts written
* A key promoter to suggest shortcuts for repetitive actions
* String manipulation (hash, base64, case conversion)

== Miscellaneous
* Code → Analyze Stack Trace
* View → Appearance → Enter presentation mode
