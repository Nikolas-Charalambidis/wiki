- `-i` edits files in-place, saving backups with the specified extension. If a zero-length extension is given, no backup will be saved. Unlike `-I`, each file is treated independently from other files.
- **Important:** In MacOS, the extension argument must be explicitly given (`-i ''` instead of `-i`).
